CircularLinkedList.java README

Objective: soldiers form a circle and count around the circle some predetermined number. When this number is reached, that person receives a lot and leaves the circle.
The count starts over with the next person. Build a circular linked list to represent the circle of people and simulate the problem. The program should use two parameters,
n people and k, where k is the number of counts.
