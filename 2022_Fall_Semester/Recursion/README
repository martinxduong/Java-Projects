eightQueens.java Objective: Write a recursive method which solves the eight queens problem. On a chestg board, find a state where you can place eight queens on a board
such that no queen can capture another queen. Queens can move and capture pieces in the same row, column, or any diagonal. For this project, use an 8x8 int[][] array 
to simulate the chest board. Only 1 queen can be placed in each column, solving this problem solves, "for this current column, which row can I put a queen on".
