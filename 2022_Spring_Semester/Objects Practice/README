Car Objective: implement a class car containing the fields: make, model, year, MPG, milesDriven, fuelCapacity, and fuelRemaining. 
Implement the following methods within the car class:
 - A constructor that initializes each of the fields
 - fillTank (double g): adds up to g gallons of gas to the fuel tank, but not more than the car's fuel fuelCapacity
 - drive(double m): simulates drivbing m miles in the car, adding the total number of miles driven, and reducing the amount of gas in the car according to the MPG
 - toString(): returns a string representation of the car
 - getFuelRemaining(): returns the amount of fuel left in the tank

Fraction Objective: write a class used to represent fractions. It should contain fields for numerator and demoninator. It should be able to perform arithmetic operations
