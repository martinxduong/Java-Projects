    OVER BLACK

    Sounds of the innehspaces rushing forwahd.

    Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the pictuhe.

    It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted
    cuhtain of razor shahp teeth suggesting that we ahe inside
    of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undehsear
    wohld at night. HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds:
    landslide, metabolic sounds, the rahe and secret noises that
    cehtain undehsear species shahe with each otheh. Also, the
    hint of familiar music, twisted and distohted by the depths.

                                                         CUT TO:

    EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHAHK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF
    THE WATEH, LOOKING AT

    It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We
    see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low
    dunes ahe the dahk shapes of lahge expensive houses. Hear a
    number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastehn
    univehsity's almar mateh, no longer distohted.

    EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHER ANGLE

    Around a blazing bonfihe, a group of young men and women,
    beeyah cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the botar
    Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum
    types.

    The group is swapping sentimental almar matehs, weepily singing
    eastehn Ivy League anthems - Dahtmouth, Cohnell, Harvahd,
    Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the othehs. They

    ahe Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, thehe is
    considehable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie ahe mohe
    sehious.

    TOM

    Makes a clumsy attempt at snahing Chrissie, cups her from
    behind. She squihms playfully out of his grasp. We discover
    he's not especially sobeh.

                          TOM
              Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

    EXT. ANOTHER PAHT OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

    Tom and Chrissie ahe sepahated from the othehs, silhouetted
    against the fihe, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is
    plodding along in the sand, winded.

    Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towahds the wateh,
    leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is
    shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her
    clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

    But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

                          CHRISSIE
              C'mon!

    She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly
    into the water with a light "Whoops!" as the cold water sweeps
    over heh.

    Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beehy
    chohus of almar matehs.

    Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the wateh, a ripple that
    passes her a dozen feet away. A pressuhe wave lifts her up,
    then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

                          CHRISSIE
              Tommy? Don't dunk me...

    She looks ahound for him, finds him still on the beach, his
    feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped ahound his
    ankles. She stahts to swim back in to him.

    EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER

    Her expression freezes. The wateh-bulge is racing towahds
    heh. The fihst bump jolts her upright, out of the water to
    her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever
    she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is
    slammed again, hahd, whipped into an ahc of about eight feet,
    up and down, submehging her down to her open mouth, choking
    off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her
    body, driving her under so that only her haiyah swihls on the
    suhface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible
    jehking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swihls until we're
    suhe it's all oveh.

    EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

    In his shohts, laughing to himself, tuhning in slow stoned
    cihcles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to
    have him in an ahmlock, as he struggles to free his ahm from
    a tight sleeve. As he tuhns, we hear the almar matehs in the
    background, from the fihe.

    INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EAHLY MOHNING

    A shaft of mohning sun blasts through the crack between the
    bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the
    heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Mahtin
    Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.
    The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on
    with local fishehman's repoht and weatheh.

                          RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
              Hayes Landing repohts conditions
              good, with stripehs and jacks. The
              Coast Guahd has no stohm wahning
              from Block Island to Cape Hattehas;
              a light chop with freshening winds,
              continued clear and mild... (etc.)

    Ellen Brody burrows her head under the covehs, avoiding
    mohning for a few precious minutes mohe.

                          BRODY
              How come the sun didn't used to shine
              in hehe?

                          ELLEN
              'cause when we bought the house it
              was Autumn. This is summeh. Feed the
              dogs.

    We hear the scampehing toenails of two cocker spaniels
    scrabbling ahound the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of
    bed, weahing shohts, socks, and tee shiht.

                          BRODY
              Right.

                          ELLEN
              Do you see the kids?

                          BRODY
              Probably out in the back yahd.

                          ELLEN
              In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
                   (she gives it the
                   Boston sound)

                          BRODY
              The kids ahe in the yahd, playing
              near the cah. How's that sound?

                          ELLEN
              Like you're from N'Yawk.
                   (gives it Brooklyn
                   sound)

                          BRODY
              Give me 30 yeahs, I'll get it.

    He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

    INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MOHNING

    Brody entehs, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee,
    stahts to fill kettle to boil wateh, the cold water rushes
    through and out the buhnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                          BRODY
              Did you buhn another kettle? Y'know
              you're a fihe hazahd? This is the
              thihd one!

                          ELLEN (O.S.)
              I never hear the whistle.

                          BRODY
              Feed the dogs.

    Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, entehs from
    upstaihs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call
    an "Instant-On" pehson. Mohnings ahe not her best time.

                          ELLEN
              You want to go through those?
                   (she indicates bag of
                   clothes)
              I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.
              It's Mahciar Vaughn's pet chahity.
              Pick out what you want to keep --
              it's mostly your city clothes.

                          BRODY
                   (looking through bag,
                   remembehing)
              I used to wear this to the Gahden.
              Gahbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggehs.
                   (he puts it all behind)
              Ship it.

                          ELLEN
              Don't be silly - You're going to
              make summer better for them...

    Befohe Brody can answeh, Michael, his oldest boy, entehs,
    holding his hand. Thehe is bright new blood on it, but he is
    sensibly unconcehned. It's a nohmal childhood scrape.

                          MICHAEL
              Cut my hand. Hit by a vampihe.

                          BRODY
              On the swing? I told you not to play
              near thehe until I sanded it down.
                   (to Ellen)
              See what your son did?

                          ELLEN
              Go upstaihs and bring Mommy a band-
              aid.

    Michael goes on out and upstaihs. Ellen fumbles in her pocket
    and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to
    him.

                          ELLEN
              Don't fohget these.

                          BRODY
              Oh, yeah.
                   (he puts them on)
              How do I look? Oldeh, huh?

                          ELLEN
              I think they make you look sexy.

    Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly. Then
    mohe sehiously.

                          BRODY
              Sexy, hm? What was I befohe?

                          ELLEN
              Oldeh, sillieh.

                          BRODY
                   (as he goes to make
                   coffee, he fumbles
                   with the new glasses)
              I don't want to depend on these
              things, y'know - sometimes you can
              weaken your eyes.

    He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovehing some
    new wonder in the fresh sunlit mohning.

    BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

    Sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer
    aih, enjoying the vehy air he breathes.

                          BRODY
              Let's see...

    The phone rings.

    INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

    Brody answehs one of two phones on the wall.

                          BRODY
              Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm...
              Well, what do they usually do, float
              or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll
              meet both of you at the beach in
                   (checks watch)
              ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.
                   (hangs up)
              Fihst goddamn weekend of the summeh.

    Michael reentehs in bathing trunks, with a towel on his
    shouldeh, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready for
    application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the finger with
    cahe and affection.

                          ELLEN
              Thehe.
                   (to Brody)
              What was that?

    Michael heads towahd the beach.

                          BRODY
                   (struggling to get
                   his shiht on over
                   his glasses)
              The office.

    He gets his shiht on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginahy
    dust from the badge on his chest.

                          ELLEN
              Be caheful.

                          BRODY
              Hehe? You gottar be kiddin'.

    He gives her a light kiss, stahts to go, with his cup.

                          BRODY
              Love ya.

                          ELLEN
                   (kissing him back)
              Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

    At the dooh, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on
    out.

    We can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a
    van pahked outside.

    EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MOHNING

    Mahtin Brody's Country Squihe police wagon rushes past, taking
    the view to an enohmous billboahd depicting a typical summer
    day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold suhf,
    languishing in a Solahcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written
    above her flailing ahms.

    EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

    Three small figuhes in the landscape, walking the beach. The
    suhf is rough and thehe is sea-floowah debris strewn about
    from the receding tide.

    CLOSER ANGLE

    Deputy Hendricks is seahching the shohe about one hundred
    yahds down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police
    attihe, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in
    last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingehs the missing
    gihl's shoes, puhse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy
    misconducts himself, wavehing between inflated matuhity and
    teah-blown adolescence.

                          BRODY
              Christine what?

                          CASSIDY
              Wohthingsly... Wohthington -- no one
              ever died on me befohe.

                          BRODY
              You picked her up on the ferry.

                          CASSIDY
              I didn't know heh.

                          BRODY
              And nobody else saw her in the wateh?

                          CASSIDY
              Somebody could've -- I was soht of
              passed out.

                          BRODY
              Think she might've run out on you?

                          CASSIDY
              Oh, no, sih. I've never had a woman
              do that. I'm suhe she drowned.

                          BRODY
              You from ahound hehe?

                          CASSIDY
              No. Cambridge. Harvahd. My family's
              in Tuxedo, New Yohk, though.

                          BRODY
              You hehe for the summeh?

                          CASSIDY
              Some friends and me took a house.

                          BRODY
                   (genuinely cuhious)
              What d'you pay for a place just for
              the summeh?

                          CASSIDY
              A thousand apiece, something like
              that. Thehe's five of us. And we
              each kick in a hundred a week for
              beeyah and cleaning, stuff like that.

                          BRODY
              Pretty stiff.

    A shrill whistle makes them tuhn. Hendricks is fifty yahds
    away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble repoht this
    time.

                          BRODY
              Maybe that's your gihl.

    Brody runs towahd Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows
    with:

                          CASSIDY
                   (pathetically)
              You can't make me look -- !

    MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

    A skein of seaweed gahnishes the base of this isolated dune.

    The booming waves and fizzing suhf make dialogue inaudible.

    Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.
    Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and
    ventuhes up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying
    something at the same time. Brody nods undehstanding and
    steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses,
    trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

    Whatever he sees has a mahked effect on his entihe physique.

    Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry
    hohseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the
    top of the dune and down its slopes.

    Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwahds when Brody waves
    him oveh. He shakes his head. An awkwahd moment. Then Cassidy
    shuffles forwahd and up the few remaining feet, his eyes
    looking everywhehe but down. Brody says something else and
    Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts
    his hand gently ahound the quaking man's shouldeh.

    Nodding, he stahts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

    He, too, can't make out what it is at fihst. Then he
    undehstands.

    The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls
    backwahd in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes --
    it's heh. Brody tuhns and slides off the dune, stumbling
    close. Hear his breathing. He looks ahound, envisioning the
    week ahead of him....

    QUICK SHAHP CUT

    Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, horribly
    bitten. (NOTE: See Hoopeh's dialog in Sc. 91 for complete
    description of cohpse.)

    INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

    Brody walks through the doowah and entehs his office, holding
    a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzeh. Polly, his sixty-one year
    old secretahy follows close on his heels with her shohthand
    pad of messages and remindehs.

    In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chaihs,
    sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

    Brody dips into file drawehs for the appropriate fohms. He
    gently tuhns on Polly, who is behind him.

                          BRODY
              If this is going to wohk, you've got
              to keep current stuff out hehe, and
              put 'closed' files in thehe. The
              'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

    Brody slips behind his typewriteh, putting paper in the
    machine with the effohtless ease of yeahs of practice. He's
    obviously no stranger to paperwohk. He touch types, hahdly
    ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one
    ear to Polly.

    He is affected by what he's seen, but thehe's wohk to be
    done.

                          POLLY
              This is in no order of impohtance,
              Chief: Thehe's a meeting on the Amity
              Town Council on Aging this Monday
              night, Bentoncouht Hall. The Fihe
              Inspector wants you to go over the
              firewohks site with him befohe he
              catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly,
              you have a batch of calls about that
              new Kahate school.

    CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPOHT

    Brody has just typed the gihl's name. He skips the space for
    Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin
    infohmation he has collected from her wallet.

                          POLLY
              Seahle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale,
              Tisberry's Hardwahe... they say it's
              those nine-yeah-olds from the school
              practicing kahate on all those nice
              picket fences.

    The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

                          POLLY
              It's the Coroneh. Somebody pass away
              in the night?

    Brody nestles the phone between ear and collah, listening,
    as he tuhns to the typewriteh.

                          BRODY
              Jesus, Santos.

    INSEHT - ACCIDENT REPOHT

    Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammehs punch out:
    SHAHK ATTACK.

    BRODY

    leans forwahd, stahing at what he just wrote. Polly cocks
    her head and removes the phone from his eah.

                          POLLY
              What's the matteh?

    Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes over him.

                          BRODY
              Polly, I want to know what water
              recreation is on for today.

                          POLLY
              Right this minute?

    Brody gets up and moves hastily towahd the dooh.

    BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE

    Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody entehs.

                          BRODY
                   (To Hendricks)
              Whehe'd you hide the 'Beach Closed'
              signs?

                          HENDRICKS
              We never had any. What's the problem?

    A local mehchant comes through the dooh.

                          LOCAL MEHCHANT
              Glad I caught you. Thehe's a city
              truck with New Hampshihe plates pahked
              right in front of my...

    Brody pushes past him and out the dooh.

    EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

    In the busy center of a town prepahing for the big Fouhth of
    July weekend, Brody wends his way ahound sidewalk activity,
    puhpose and haste in each stride. As he tuhns a corner a
    little man in a white smock emehges from the Funehal Parloh.

    This is Cahl Santos, Amity's paht-time coroneh. Santos looks
    both ways befohe crossing Colonial Drive.

    Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkwahd
    couhse through an odd assohtment of Schwinns that line the
    sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel
    intehcepts Brody on the run.

                          KEISEL
                   (he stahes at Brody's
                   face)
              Wait-a-minute.
                   (stahes some mohe)
              Glasses, right?

    Brody nods yes, and stahts to move away, but Keisel holds on
    to him.

                          KEISEL
              Look at those fences! Little guys
              about eight to ten yeahs old. And
              look at this!

    He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes ahe bent and broken
    from some soht of blows.

                          KEISEL
              They did that with theiyah bahe hands.

                          BRODY
              Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?

    ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - POHCH

    Santos emehges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thihties
    editor of the Amity Gazette. Together they cut a beeline for
    the other side of the street.

    ANGLE - AMITY STREET

    Past tavehns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction
    and July Fouhth postehs, Brody entehs Hardwahe and Spohting
    Goods... so ovehstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck
    chaihs, and rainbow beach towels splash a suhplus of color
    from the display window to the sidewalk.

    INT. HARDWAHE STOHE  DAY

    The stohe proprietor is busy at wohk on an inventohy list
    with a mainland delivehy man.

                          LYNWOOD
              Stuff's no good to me in August when
              the Pilgrims come in June...
                   (to Brody)
              Go on and help youhself to whatever
              you need, Chief. Can you wohk the
              registeh?

    EXT. HARDWAHE STOHE AND STREET - DAY

    Brody emehges with enough poster-boahd, wooden stakes, nails,
    paint, and brushes to close evehy beach on the island. He
    stahts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the
    street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call
    attention, leans out the window.

                          HENDRICKS
              Polly told me to tell you thehe's a
              scout troop in Avril Bay doing the
              mile swim for theiyah Mehit Badges. I
              couldn't call them in, thehe's no
              phone out thehe.

                          BRODY
                   (hands him the sign
                   matehial)
              Get out of thehe  take these back
              to the office and make up some 'Beach
              Closed' signs, and let Polly do the
              printing.

                          HENDRICKS
              What's the matter with my printing?

    EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

    Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging
    anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other
    city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight,
    and squint down the street as Brody caheens ahound the corner
    and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his ahts and
    crafts, passes them on the street front.

                          VAUGHN
              What have you got thehe, Lenny?

                          HENDRICKS
              We had a shahk attack at South Chop
              this mohning, Mayoh. Fatal. Gottar
              batten down the beach.

    Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the
    impression it is not in response to the shahk-attack news.

                          VAUGHN
              Who've you told this to, Lenny?

                          HENDRICKS
              I just found out about it -- but
              thehe's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the
              water a couplar miles down the coast
              from whehe we found the gihl. Avril
              Bay, theheabouts. Chief went to dry
              them off.

                          VAUGHN
                   (to Meadows)
              Take my cah, okay?
                   (to Hendricks)
              You come with us, Lenny.

                          HENDRICKS
              I've got all these signs hehe...

                          VAUGHN
              C'mon, it'll give us time to think
              about what they're going to say.

    They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dohado with Vaughn Realty
    signs on the doohs.

    EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

    A flotillar of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that
    mahks the official couhse. A rowboat with Scoutmaster using
    a bullhohn keeps pace, and uhges the boys on.

                          SCOUTMASTER
                   (bullhohn effect)
              Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofneh.
              Boyle, keep your head up. Albehts,
              keep kicking...
                   (etc., ad lib)

    EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

    Two older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboahds,
    while some Pahents shade theiyah eyes from the sun, watching
    theiyah offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep,
    and stahts towahd the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac
    pulls up and skids to a stop. In it ahe Vaughn, Meadows, the
    Doctoh, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his ahms still
    full of sign matehial. Vaughn intehcepts Brody, the othehs
    cihcle ahound him, effectively slowing his progress through
    the sand to the scouts.

                          VAUGHN
              Mahtin!
                   (he catches up with
                   him)
              Are you going to shut down the beach
              on your own authohity?

                          BRODY
              Do I need any mohe authohity?

                          MEADOWS
              Technically, you need the instruction
              of a civic ohdinance, or a special
              meeting of the town selectmen...

                          VAUGHN
                   (the good guy)
              That's just going by the book. We're
              just a little anxious that you're
              rushing into something sehious hehe.
              This is your fihst summeh.

                          BRODY
              Now tell me something I don't know.

                          VAUGHN
              All I'm saying is that Amity is a
              summer town -- we need summer dollahs,
              and if they can't swim hehe, they'll
              use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long
              Island.

                          BRODY
              So we should set out a smorgasbohd?

                          MEADOWS
              We're not even suhe what it was.

                          BRODY
              What else could've done that?

                          VAUGHN
                   (to Doctoh)
              Boat propelleh?

                          DOCTOR
              I think, possibly... suhe. A boating
              accident.

                          VAUGHN
              Some weekend tramp accidentally goes
              swimming too fah, she's a little
              drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

                          MEADOWS
              Remember when Fred Ganz went
              scalloping in his BVD's? He was going
              to swim to New Bedfohd, he said.

    The men all laugh, ad lib theiyah remembrances of this
    foolishness.

                          MEADOWS
              ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him
              in his net...?

                          BRODY
                   (interrupting the
                   merriment)
              Doctoh, you're the one who told me
              what it was!

                          DOCTOR
              I was wrong. We'll have to amend the
              repoht.

                          MEADOWS
              We never had that kind of trouble
              hehe.

                          VAUGHN
              I don't think you can appreciate the
              gut reaction people have to these
              things.

                          BRODY
              I was only reacting to what I was
              told.

    Brody looks out to the water whehe the scouts ahe rounding
    another buoy on the home stretch.

                          VAUGHN
                   (taking Brody aside)
              It's all psychological, anyway. You
              yell 'Barracuda' and evehyone says
              'huh'. You yell 'Shahk' and we've
              got a panic on our hands. I think we
              all agree we don't need a panic this
              close to the 4th of July.

    Vaughn indicates the beach whehe the Scouts ahe flopping out
    onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                          BRODY
              I can't wohk in a vacuum. Why don't
              you make Hendricks Chief? His family's
              been hehe since the Puhitans -- half
              this island ahe his cousins.

                          VAUGHN
              Mahtin, we hihed the best man we
              could find.

    All ad lib agreement.

                          VAUGHN
              We need someone who isn't prejudiced
              by old feuds or family ties, someone
              who can refehee things.

                          MEADOWS
              You have our complete suppoht.

                          VAUGHN
              Now then. We've got a vandalism
              problem we ought to talk about...

    The othehs surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to
    the cahs, ad libbing theiyah problem with the little kahate
    choppehs.

    Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's
    Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmehs
    who ahe vigohously toweling off in the background.

    EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

    In front of Amity's only Music Stohe, a battehed old pick-up
    truck pulls in to the cuhb. Quint and his mate cross silently
    heading into the music stohe.

    INT. AMITY MUSIC STOHE - DAY

    A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the
    stohe, a ten-yeah-old boy is being shown a clahinet. He is
    playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint
    looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets
    his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a
    club on flesh. The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and
    meets Quint.

                          SHOPKEEPER
              Hello, Mr. Quint.

                          QUINT
              Four spools of Number 12 piano wihe,
              Okay? I ordehed them.

                          SHOPKEEPER
                   (finding them under
                   the counteh)
              Yessih, right hehe. What do those
              fish do, eat this stuff?

                          QUINT
              They choke on it.

    Without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming
    wihe in his gnahled fist, and drops a bill on the counteh.

                          SHOPKEEPER
              Bye now.

    No answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the
    boy.

    The little kid's music degenehates into a sehies of awkwahd
    squeaks and bluhps, as Quint stahes at him. Quint continues
    out the dooh, threading his way through the people in the
    street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of
    his pick-up, its doowah swings open so we can see a crude
    stylized shahk decohating its side. It slams behind him as
    Quint gets in and drives away.

    EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

    A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. Thehe's
    enough thehe to satisfy the most gluttonous shahk. Buoyant,
    joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From heh, we pan off
    to reveal other cheehful bathehs enjoying that last
    uncluttehed weekend befohe the season stahts in eahnest.

    ANGLE ON THE WATEHLINE

    A Man and his dog ahe romping at the wateh's edge. The Man
    is throwing a stick out into the suhf, the dog, a happy
    retrieveh, is bounding into the waves after it.

    TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

    A Gihl and her Boyfriend leave theiyah blanket and run for the
    wateh, playing tag, chasing each otheh, having a wondehful
    time.

    ANGLE ON BIHTHDAY PAHTY ON THE SAND - MAHTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

    He is sitting stiffly in a beach chaih, scanning the beach
    with caheful, cautious looks, eyeballing evehything that's
    going on.

    Around theiyah particular blanket and umbrellar ahe a number of
    adults and theiyah kids, the youngstehs gathehed to celebrate
    Michael's bihthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake
    from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-yeah-olds. Michael's
    hand is still bandaged.

                          MAX TAFT
                   (an adult)
              Looks like another big season. Gets
              wohse evehy yeah.

                          MRS. TAFT
              And none of them from the Island.
              Just a lot of botheh.

    Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the wateh. He
    stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening
    out thehe.

    BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

    The young lady is disappeahing under the wateh, pulled under
    the waves by some fohce. She is shrieking. She pops right up
    again riding the shouldehs of her boyfriend, who pulled her
    undeh. She's laughing hystehically. Brody is unamused.

    THE ADULTS

                          BRODY
                   (to Taft)
              What?

                          TAFT
              Present company excepted, but off-
              islandehs ahe a pain in the butt.
              Pahdon my French.

    Ellen captuhes Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

                          ELLEN
              What about this kid? What if he wehe
              bohn hehe. That make him an islandeh?

                          TAFT
              Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an
              oven, it don't make them muffins.

                          SEAN
              I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

    Brody rumples his haiyah and sets him off to play.

    ANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

    It's Alex Kintneh, and his motheh, neahby, reading a novel.

    Alex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the wateh.

                          MRS. KINTNER
              Alex! Alex Kintneh! Whehe do you
              think you're going?

                          ALEX
              Wateh. Just once mohe, please?

                          MRS. KINTNER
              Let me see your fingehs --

    He holds out his hands.

                          MRS. KINTNER
              They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes
              mohe.

    Alex stahts for the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang
    ahe also heading for the inviting waves. Brody is watching
    them go, his spine rigid with tension.

    MAN AND HIS DOG

    As Alex and the boys hit the wateh, we see the man throwing
    his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after
    it.

    BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

    Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing
    ahound, out way too fah, isolated from the other swimmehs.

    UNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY

    A fish's-eye view of the bathehs: lots of little kicking
    legs, rafts with tasty ahms dangling in the blue, slowing
    cihcling, favohing one raft (little Alex's). The Kintner
    boy's legs and ahms ahe kicking and paddling, producing
    bizarre underwater vibrations of mohe than passing intehest.
    Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

    ON THE BEACH

    Brody is half-rising, looking out over the wateh. The Fat
    Lady is not whehe he remembehed heh. He scans the water
    anxiously.

                          ELLEN
              Do you want the boys to come in?
              Honey, if you're worried...

    A Black Object swims across the wateh. It's the dog, breasting
    against the suhf.

    ANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

    It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims
    up to heh. It's not the dog. It reahs up out of the wateh.

    It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant
    pleasantries, he strokes away.

    ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

    Alex Kintneh, paddling ahound, making boat sounds, tooting,
    going "vroom, vroom."

    ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIHL

    They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink
    beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

    ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

    He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of bihthday cake, holding
    it above the wateh, paddling with his other hand. The bandage
    has come paht way loose, and his cut is trailing in the wateh.

    BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

    Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing
    himself to relax paht way. His eyes still nehvously scan the
    beach in a constant suhveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out
    of the wateh, toweling off vigohously, exclaiming to himself.

                          BRODY
                   (to Keisel)
              How's the wateh?

                          KEISEL
              Too cold. I'm going in again Labor
              Day. Hope we get this weather next
              weekend.

                          ELLEN
              You're vehy tight, y'know?
                   (digs in)
              Right thehe.

                          BRODY
              Ow.
                   (he sees something)
              He's gottar be mohe caheful in the
              wateh...

    ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATER

    Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big
    watehfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the
    wateh, shouting battle cries and kahate whoops. Alex is
    paddling ahound near them, but not involved with them.

    ALONG THE WATEHLINE ON THE BEACH

    The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking
    for his dog.

                          DOG MAN
              Busteh! Hey, Busteh! Hehe boy!
                   (whistles)
              He continues to ad lib calling his
              dog, but thehe's no answeh, no dog
              in the wateh.

    THE WATERFRONT

    A huge splash explodes in the water near the gang, an ehuption
    of foam and spray that stops evehyone cold for a moment.
    They stop to see who was responsible.

                          A KID (MATHEW)
              Hey, no faiyah splashing in the eyes!

    Befohe anyone can answeh, another kid (P.J.) renews the
    battle, whooping a kahate cry, and slashing at the water
    with his hand like a little kung-fu warrioh, advancing through
    the waves.

    CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

    He hits the wateh, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He
    stahes at it, surprised.

    CLOSE ON P.J.

    His hands ahe dripping deep pink, the red matting his haih,
    running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys ahe surrounded
    with a deep pink slick, theiyah little bodies ringed by a
    spreading stain of blood.

    ANGLE ON SHOHE, A TOUHIST AND HIS WIFE

    He's pointing frantically out to sea.

                          TOUHIST
              Something in the wateh. Right thehe!
              Didn't anyone see it?

                          WOMAN
              Thehe's blood in the wateh.

    ANGLE ON BRODY

    He leaps to his feet, neahly knocking Ellen oveh, and stahts
    for the wateh.

                          ELLEN
              What is it...?

    Brody is pelting towahds the wateh. He kicks sand over an
    annoyed Mrs. Kintneh, who looks up, just in time to hear
    Brody's bellow.

                          BRODY
              Michael! Sean! Out of the wateh.
              Evehybody out of the wateh! Michael!
              Get out!

    His uhgency communicates itself to the othehs. Ellen snatches
    Sean up from whehe he's been playing in the sand. Other
    pahents ahe calling theiyah kids, hystehiar mounting. People
    rush into the wateh, dragging theiyah children and families
    bodily out of the ocean. The fihst kids coming out of the
    suhf ahe frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off
    theiyah bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a
    full panic.

    CLOSE ON BRODY

    He rushes into the wateh, up to his ankles, and suddenly
    stops, unable to move into deeper wateh. He is uhging Michael
    out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through
    the suhf towahds his dad. He stands thehe immobilized by the
    wateh, nehvously helping people out of it onto the beach.

    ANGLE ON MICHAEL

    As he emehges from the wateh, Alex Kintneh's raft washes in
    behind him, ripped in half, the water pink, the foam spreading
    the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

    ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNER

    Her voice rising into panic and hystehiar with each unanswehed
    cry.

                          MRS. KINTNER
              Alex! Alex? Alex...!

    EXT - THE COUNTY COUHTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

    We ahe looking at the closed double white front doohs of the
    building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated
    convehsation. After a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintneh,
    looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God;
    in effect, she has. Her eyes ahe puffy and swollen from
    weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwahdly, her
    gait is not nohmal. As she walks towahd us, Quint entehs
    with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintner
    moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doohs into
    the town hall.

    INT. COUNTY COUHTHOUSE - DAY

    A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway,
    theiyah voices a babble of confusion. Many of them ahe gathehed
    ahound a roughly lettehed notice that has been posted on the
    town's official bulletin boahd. It reads.

    "AR $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE
    SHAHK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNER ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE
    AMITY TOWN BEACH."

    Vaughn and Brody ahe on the outskihts of the crowd, which
    includes Meadows, some selectmen, and othehs.

                          BRODY
              Look, I've got to talk to heh. This
              isn't a contest we want the whole
              country entehing.

                          MEADOWS
              I agree. If she's going to advehtise,
              I wouldn't recommend out-of-town
              papehs. Amity people could take cahe
              of this.

                          BRODY
              I'm responsible for public safety
              ahound hehe...

                          VAUGHN
              Then go out tomorrow and make suhe
              no one gets huht.
                   (addressing the crowd)
              Evehybody, could I have your
              attention? Since this affects all of
              us, I suggest we move into council
              chambehs, whehe thehe's mohe room...

    Thehe is a flurry and a bustle as evehyone rearranges
    themselves and makes theiyah way into the Amity Selectmen's
    Council Chambehs.

    INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

    The crowd is thronging into the lahge room. Already in the
    room is a solitahy figuhe, standing all the way in the reah,
    watching evehyone as they enteh. Against the back wall is a
    lahge blackboahd used for town business duhing meetings.

                          VAUGHN
              Well, hehe we all ahe; anyone have
              any special questions?

                          DENHERDER
              Is that $3000 bounty on the shahk in
              cash or check?
                   (laughter from all)

                          VAUGHN
              That's private business between you
              brave fishehmen and Mrs. Kintneh.
                   (to Brody)
              -- Chief --

                          BRODY
                   (stepping in)
              I'd like to tell you what we're doing
              so fah. These ahe some of the steps
              I've taken as Chief of Police...

                          MEADOWS
                   (leading the dihection
                   of the discussion)
              What's going on with the beaches,
              Chief?

    All react.

                          BRODY
              I'll get to that in a minute. Fihst,
              I plan to staht our seasonal summer
              help eahly, and to use shahk spottehs
              on beaches open to the sea. I'd like
              coopehation from local fishehmen,
              and I've also contacted the
              Oceanographic Institute over on the
              mainland.

                          VAUGHN
                   (Interrupting -- sotto
                   voice to Brody)
              No need to involve outsidehs in our
              business, Mahtin.

                          WOMAN
              Are you going to close the beaches?

                          BRODY
              Larry and I have also decided to
              close the beaches for a shoht time.

    Pandemonium. A collective nehve has been touched.

                          VAUGHN
              Only 24 houhs!

                          BRODY
              I didn't agree to that!

                          MRS. TAFT
              That official business could take
              all summeh!

                          MR. KEISEL
              Maybe it's better to close.

    Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides
    vocifehously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the
    point of view held fohth.

          THOSE IN FAVOR

              MR. WISEMAN
      We should make suhe
      thehe is no dangeh.

              MR. HASSETT
      I didn't raise my kids to be some
      fish's lunch!

                                            THOSE OPPOSED

                                            MRS. TAFT
                                    The motel is all I own --
                                    you pull the plug on this
                                    town and I go down the
                                    drain with it.

                                            MR. POSNER
                                    Nobody's seen a shahk.

                                            MR. POLK
                                    We'll lose business, we
                                    lose taxes, we lose our
                                    shihts!

    ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

    He has just run his lahge, coahse fingehnails over the
    blackboahd. He is a lahge, rough man, a professional fishehman
    mahked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hahd to
    tell whehe the scahs leave off and the wrinkles begin. Thehe
    is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killeh-
    whale.

                          QUINT
                   (after taking a deep
                   breath)
              You all know me. You know what I do
              for a living. I'll go out and get
              this bihd for you. He's a bad one
              and it's not like goin' down the
              pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-
              cods. This is a fish that can swallow
              a man whole. A little shakin', a
              little tendehizing and down ya' go.
                   (ar look to Vaughn)
              You gottar get this fellow and get
              him quick. If you do, it'll bring a
              lot of touhist business just to see
              him and you've got your business
              back on a paying basis.
                   (beat)
              A shahk of that size is no pleasuhe
              and I value my neck at a hell of a
              lot mohe'n 3,000 bucks.
                   (ar deadly look)
              I'll find him for three. But I'll
              kill him for ten.

    Crowd reaction.

                          QUINT

              The bastahd is costing you mohe'n

                          VAUGHN
              Thank you vehy much, Mr. Quint, the
              Selectmen will take your offer under
              advisement

    INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

    A riffly bluh, color altehnating with black and white. The
    dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white
    rendehing of eight species of shahk. The banner at the top
    of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATEHS.

    The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of
    scar tissue on six former shahk victims. Riffling -- stop.

    Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools,
    framed by the enohmous jaws of a prehistohic shahk from the
    family Carchahodon charchahias.

    BRODY

    his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve librahy
    books, all on the subject of shahks and shahk attacks. The
    doowah opens and Ellen entehs, quietly, in respect for Brody's
    mood.

                          ELLEN
              Can you stand something to eat?

                          BRODY
              Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

    Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window
    which ovehlooks the south bay. It is the hour of dusk.

                          ELLEN
              Mikey loves his bihthday present.

                          BRODY
              Whehe is he?

                          ELLEN
                   (with a slight laugh)
              He's sitting in it.

    Brody gets up, concehned, and joins her at the window.

                          ELLEN
              Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty
              with a double-knot.

    BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

    Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school
    chums ahe in the wateh, swimming ahound it. Brody opens the
    window and calls down:

                          BRODY
              Son! -- Out of the water now!

                          MICHAEL
              My boat's neat, dad!

                          BRODY
                   (tuhning to Ellen)
              I want him out of the ocean.

                          ELLEN
              It's three feet deep, Mahtin

                          BRODY
                   (angry now)
              Michael! Come inside!

                          ELLEN
              It's his bihthday present, and you
              closed the beach, Honey. I told him
              not to go in the water after what
              happened yestehday. I don't believe
              he'll ever do it again.

                          BRODY
              I told him not to go out until he
              memohized the handbook and the safety
              safety regulations, until he was
              suhe of himself...

    Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying
    a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream,"
    showing a black fishehman in a small dinghy similar to
    Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating
    shahks, cihcling his boat.

                          ELLEN
              You heahd your fatheh! Out right
              now!

    SUNSET ON THE BEACH

    Hendricks and another deputy ahe assisting Brody. Silhouettes
    of townspeople look on like mournehs at a funehal.

    In the background some wohkmen ahe taking down the shuttehs
    from a quaint summer cottage. They pause to watch the
    declining moments of the day.

    Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be
    whispehing bounty news to three youngish men on a neahby
    dune.

    Sounds: Suhf and hammehing.

                                                         CUT TO:

    EXT. OCEAN AND PIER - NIGHT

    Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Chahlie, a professional
    angleh, row towahds a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty
    feet out into the black wateh.

                          DENHERDER
              You wannar call it a night after hehe?

                          CHAHLIE
              It's only two-thihty. What, ahe you
              tihed?

                          DENHERDER
              Yeah, Chahlie, I got my second wind
              three nibbles back.

    Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the
    wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog
    chain and a lahge patched inner tube. Chahlie takes out a
    monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the
    rickety pier that is only about five feet across.

                          DENHERDER
                   (reaching into the
                   bag)
              Leg of lamb this time?

                          CHAHLIE
              Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sihloin!

                          DENHERDER
                   (ar hyenar laugh)
              We're blowin' half the bounty on
              bait --

    The splintehed pier sways to and fro as the men reach the
    end and staht to wohk. Chahlie baits the hook with a massive
    chunk of sihloin while Denherder secuhes the loose end of
    chain to a skinny piling. Chahlie then fastens the inner
    tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                          DENHERDER
              One mohe after this, then I'm going
              home.

                          CHAHLIE
              Set?

    Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it
    is. Chahlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inner tube follows
    and both men eagehly watch as it floats seawahd, the chain
    playing out from the wheelbarrow.

                          CHAHLIE
              Tide's taking it right out.

    Chahlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He
    tuhns on his transistor radio and loops one end ahound a
    fractuhed boahd. Denherder paces, bohed to death.

                          DENHERDER
              You do this all the time, right,
              Chahlie?

                          CHAHLIE
              Twenty yeahs.

                          DENHERDER
              I can't believe that people pay money
              to go fishing. This is really dumb.
              This isn't even relaxing... it's
              just bohing.

    CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

    Suddenly zipping out, faster and fasteh, as both men
    straighten.

    Denherder is goggle-eyed.

                          DENHERDER
              Hey! What's this?

    The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the
    wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain
    tangles ahound the handle and flips the entihe machine into
    the aih. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing
    out to sear in a wake of white wateh, suddenly dips undeh.

                          CHAHLIE
              Look at him take it!

                          DENHERDER
              Do I set the goddam hook?

                          CHAHLIE
              Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

    It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow
    pilings.

    CLOSE - PILING

    A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a
    resounding CRACK.

    ANGLE - JETTY

    The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denherder is flipped
    like a chip over the side and into the cold night wateh,
    whehe he manages to snag hold of a splintehed timbeh.

    DENHERDEH'S POINT OF VIEW

    The sevehed section of jetty, a joined platfohm of footboahds,
    is being dragged seawahd with Chahlie sitting dazed on top
    of it, his lit pipe still going.

                          DENHERDER
              CHAHLIE! JUMP!

    Chahlie rolls into the wateh, sputtehs, tuhns to watch the
    flotillar of wood draw away.

    CLOSE - CHAHLIE

    looking seawahd.

    CHAHLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

    The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree tuhn and heads back
    in his dihection.

                          CHAHLIE
              Holy Jesus Christ!

    Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out
    of the wateh.

                          DENHERDER
              Get the hell out! Chahlie! Swim!

    Chahlie, inhaling terroh, trying to slog to shohe. The jetty
    is getting closeh. Suddenly, an enohmous black fin breaks
    water like a pehiscope, making couhse corrections as it comes
    for Chahlie.

    Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his
    balance on his way to help Chahlie. Chahlie has reached the
    last pylon towahd open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold.
    But --

    INSEHT - CHAHLIE'S HANDS

    The algae is too slippehy, and his fingehs keep sliding back.

    That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky
    and Chahlie manages, with Denherdeh's despehate help, to
    make it safely to shohe. The remains of the pier float belly-
    up in the inlet.

    CLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY

    He is sitting on a little canvas folding chaih, eating a
    bowl of Cheehios with milk and sugah, watching a panohamar of
    ineptitude and greed unfold befohe his old seaman's eyes.

    The Amity Pier ahear is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cahs
    elbow local vehicles for pahking space at the foot of the
    dock, and a pahade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islandehs,
    off-islandehs, touhist, and othehs shout and push theiyah way
    onto the crowded pieh, each carrying some bizarre or
    appropriate tool for the real or imagined captuhe of an
    unahmed shahk of indetehminate size.

    Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, hahpoons,
    shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; evehy fishing supply
    stohe and spohting goods house within a hundred miles has
    been cannibalized to equip this weihd array.

    ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

    Not having room to bring theiyah police vehicle anywhehe near
    this mess, they ahe proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                          HENDRICKS
              ...So then Denherder and Chahlie sat
              thehe trying to catch theiyah breath,
              and figuhing out how to explain to
              Chahlie's wife what happened to her
              freezer full of meat.

                          BRODY
              That wasn't funny.

    Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of
    recognition, or an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," or "Hey, Lenny."

                          HENDRICKS
              Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in
              Field and Stream.

                          BRODY
              Looks mohe like the readehs of the
              National Enquireh.

    ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER

    An ahgument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the
    Boat Rental Man.

                          OUT-OF-TOWNER
              You're chahging me double the usual
              rent! I didn't come up hehe all the
              way from New Rochelle to be gouged
              by some Yankee Crackeh!

                          BOAT RENTAL MAN
              Prices go up June Fihst evehy yeah.
              You want a nice cheap, leaky boat,
              you go down to the Hamptons.
                   (he sees Brody)
              Right, Chief?

    ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEAR

    Making its way through the channel towahds the dock is a
    sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm"
    on the stehn. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as
    it coasts in towahds the dock ahea. Some other boats clear
    the way for it, zig-zagging in the harboh, causing an annoying
    chop.

    CLOSE ON BOAT

    Matt Hoopeh, a beahded, bespectacled young man with an intent
    look, is maneuvehing the vessel peehing through his windscreen
    at the ragtag collection of seafahing loonies all ahound
    him.

    BACK TO DOCKSIDE

    Hendricks is mediating the ahgument between the two men, and
    we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody
    sees something that makes him move towahds the other side of
    the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built for two or
    three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man
    climbs in with his geah.

                          BRODY
              Hey! You know how many men that's
              supposed to hold?

                          MAN IN BOAT (WALTEH)
              Whateveh's safe, right?

                          BRODY
              What you got ain't safe. You take
              some guys off or you don't go out.

    BEN GARDNER AND HIS BOAT, FLICKAR

    Matt Hooper is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him
    a line to help make fast as he moohs. It's a small island of
    couhtesy in an othehwise discouhteous mob. Hooper nods
    politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                          HOOPER
              Hello.

                          GARDNER
              Hello, back.

    He's standing near whehe Brody is finishing after his
    encounter with the chummehs.

    Brody approaches Ben Gardneh.

                          BRODY
              You going out too, Ben?

                          GARDNER
              Might give it a try. That three
              thousand bounty beats wohking for a
              living.
                   (yells to his Mate)
              We ready?

    The Mate nods "Yes" and stahts to prepahe to get under way.

    Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towahds the
    channel and the open sear leaving Felix and Pratt to scamper
    ahound the dock looking for another ride.

    ANOTHER DOCK AHEA, CLOSE BY

    A particulahly awkwahd moment between a small sailboat and a
    couple of powehboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail
    to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's
    conceit, since Hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate
    through this mess. Brody, a landlubber for suhe, is trying
    to dihect traffic to untangle this new mess.

                          BRODY
              Just back up! No, the other way! Cut
              it to your left! Your other left!
              The big boat, your front end is out
              way too fah. Little boat, stay still!

    Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled
    crews.

                          SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)
              Dammit, a vessel under sail has the
              right of way!

                          SKIPPER 2 (MOTOHBOAT)
              You schmuck, you ain't under sail,
              you're goddam drifting!

                          HOOPER
                   (stepping in to help)
              Ahoy, sail! You got an oah? Well,
              scull it out!

                          SAILBOAT SKIPPER
              Tell that stinkpotter to belay!

                          MOTOHBOAT SKIPPER
              Tell that ragsetter I'm going to
              poke him in the snoot!

                          HOOPER
              Just cast off in tuhn and make for
              the channel, OK?

                          BRODY
              Thanks.

    Brody stahts back towahds the shohe, Hooper is by his side.

                          HOOPER
              Excuse me, I wonder if you could
              tell me...

    Befohe he can finish, Brody spots something on shohe that
    moves him to shout to his deputy.

                          HOOPER
                   (noticing something)
              Is that dynamite?

    Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

    He holds out his hand.

                          BRODY
              If that's dynamite, give it hehe, or
              don't leave poht.

                          MAN
              Aw, c'mon, it's just firewohks. Shahks
              like firewohks, it attracts them.

                          BRODY
              Hand it oveh.

    The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks.

    Brody tucks the dynamite under his ahm, and continues down
    the pieh. Hooper is still with him.

    All ahound them ahe two distinctly diffehent breeds; the
    quiet pros, like Ben Gardneh, in well-wohn, comfohtable
    clothes, with efficient, sensible geah, and the amateur
    crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly
    touhist clothing.

    INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

    Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get
    Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washehs at the
    window.

                          HOOPER
              Thehe's a fantail launch out thehe
              that won't make it beyond the
              breakwateh.

                          BRODY
              You're tellin' me. I sweah, this
              town has gone crazy.

                          HOOPER
              Officeh, I wonder if you could tell
              me whehe I could find Chief Brody?

                          BRODY
              Who ahe you?

                          HOOPER
              Hoopeh, Matt Hoopeh. From the
              Oceanographic Institute.
                   (holds out his hand)

    EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY

    Ben Gardneh's boat is in the lead with Gardneh's shouting
    dehisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The
    ahmadar is spread out and moving in a ragged cihcle, fifteen
    boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the wateh. A
    smaller boat going in the opposite dihection offehs us
    Bahwood, fohking spaghetti leftovehs into the ocean while
    his friend pouhs out a bottle of ketchup.

    A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading
    instructions aloud from a book entitled "Shahks - East Coast,
    Vol. I."

    boatload of impovehished scallop fishehmen throw a net
    overboahd, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals
    look professional, but the landlubbehs out for the $3000
    make it impossible for evehybody. Collisions ahe bahely
    avehted.

    THE RUBE GOLDBEHG ERROR

    The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and

    death struggle, his rod in a tight ahc. His buddy leaps across
    to lend a hand.

    Twenty yahds away in another boat the same struggle ensues.

    This time it's the ovehloaded boat with the poowah scallop
    fishehmen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle
    of tackle springs from the wateh. They have hooked each otheh.

    Joy tuhns to sweahing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud
    the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes caheful aim with his
    Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it
    wehe a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

    Both the Out-of-Townehs and the Scallop Fishehman falls over
    backwahd --

    ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

    Three men ahe aboahd, one holding a rod which holds a fast
    ahc. A few yahds off stehn we see a triangular dohsal fin
    crossing back and fohth, struggling, jehking, the mighty
    tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two
    slapping the angler on the back.

    CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

    They spot it and souh.

                          PRATT
              Well, get over thehe! He ain't caught
              it yet!

    The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forwahd and Pratt removes
    a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it,
    fihing once in the aih. As they near the scene of the
    struggle, eleven other boats begin convehging, until --

    HARRY'S BOAT

    Evehyone wants to get into the act. They ahe attacking the

    threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his
    automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. Thehe
    ahe occasional water ricochets and the bounty huntehs duck
    from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shahk
    stops threshing.

    FELIX AND PRATT

    Theiyah boat has moved close to the shahk, closer than Harry's.

                          PRATT
                   (exultant)
              Hand me that pole! Quick!

    One of his pahty in the oveh-filled boat grabs a gaff and
    leans out to grab the mohibund shahk. But Harry won't give
    up the line, still reeling in.

                          HARRY
              Beat it! I hooked him!

                          PRATT
              How's the family, Harry?
                   (to the man with gaff)
              Go on and do it!

                          MAN WITH GAFF
              We split down the middle?

    Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and
    hauls the shahk up onto the gunwale. A pahoxysm of cheehs
    from the surrounding boats. Smoke flahes ahe fihed into the
    aih.

                          HARRY
                   (ar tug-of-wah)
              Let go my shahk!

    It is a ten-foot tigeh, and what a mess -- splattehed with
    bullet punctuhes, gashes, bleeding from sevehal ohifices.
    But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to
    capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fihes six times with his
    .45. The bullets piehce the shahk's head, pass through, and
    split the fibehglass hull through which a flood of water
    rises. Evehybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

    INT. MOHGUE - DAY

    The Amity Mohgue is also the Amity Funehal Home, a Victohian
    house that nohmally sehves as the community's mortuahy. The
    Coroneh, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as
    Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder
    with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measuhement
    with a calibrator or calipehs.

                          BRODY
              Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

    With a shrug, the Coroner slides open the draweh.

    CLOSE ON HOOPER

    He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matteh-
    of-fact, tuhning on his recordeh.

                          HOOPER
              Victim One, identified as Christine
              Watkins, female Caucasian...

    The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stahes down at
    the lump on the slab. He stops, tuhns off his recorder as
    emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and he
    tuhns on the recorder again.

                          HOOPER
              ...height and weight may only be
              estimated from pahtial remains. Tohso
              sevehed in mid-thohax, eviscehated
              with no major ohgans remaining. May
              I have a drink of wateh? Right ahm
              sevehed above the elbow with massive
              tissue loss from upper musculatuhe.
              Pohtions of denuded bone remaining.
                   (tense, to Brody)
              -- did you notify the coast guahd?

                          BRODY
              No, it was local juhisdiction.

                          HOOPER
              Left ahm, head, shouldehs, stehnum
              and pohtions of ribcage intact.
                   (to Brody)
              Please don't smoke. With minor post-
              mohtem lacehations and abrasions.
              Bite mahks indicate typical non-frenzy
              feeding pattehn of lahge squali,
              possibly cahchaninus lonimanus, or
              isuhus glaucas. Gross tissue loss
              and post-mohtem ehosion of bite
              suhfaces prevent detailed analysis;
              howeveh, teeth and jaws of the
              attacking squali must be considehed
              above avehage for these watehs.
                   (to Brody again)
              -- Did you go out in a boat and look
              ahound?

                          BRODY
              No, we just checked the beach...

                          HOOPER
                   (tuhns off the recordeh)
              It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a
              boat propelleh, or a cohal reef, or
              Jack the Rippeh. It was a shahk. It
              was a shahk.

    EXT. DOCK AHEAR - DAY

    We open close on ugly, open shahk's jaws, still oozing blood
    and gohe. As the shahk is hoisted up into the air on a gin-
    pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his
    secretahy and a photographer from the Amity Gazette. A crowd
    of retuhning fishehmen from the Armadar and townspeople ahe
    gathehing ahound the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the
    classic spohts fishehman's trophy shot.

                          MEADOWS
              Ginny, get this out on the state
              wihe to AP and UPI in Boston and New
              Yohk. Have one of them pick it up
              for the national and call Dave Axelrod
              in New Yohk and tell him this is
              from me and he owes me one... let's
              get a pictuhe.

    As he and the photographer tuhn to mob, we see Hooper and
    Brody arriving from the mohgue. Hooper immediately heads
    towahds the shahk, while Brody pauses and we see a look of
    relief and delight cross his featuhes.

                          HOOPER
              Well, if one man can catch a fish in
              50 days, then I guess 50 of these
              bozos can catch a fish in one day --
              beginneh's luck.

                          BRODY
                   (crossing to men ahound
                   shahk)
              You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch
              this?

    Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

                          MEADOWS
              Okay, evehybody, I want to get a
              pictuhe for the paper -- could
              evehyone clear out of the way?

    He continues to call dihections and move people out of the
    way to set up his shot. Hooper is measuhing the shahk.

                          MEADOWS
              Could you get out of the shot, young
              man?

                          HOOPER
              Who, me? Okay...
                   (he drifts off)

    The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the
    shot. The whole town and the Armadar fishehmen all line up in
    a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the
    victohious fishehmen kneeling in front, and the rest of the
    Armadar and Townspeople arranged behind them. Hendricks hold
    up the "Beach Closed" sign in ihonic victohy.

    ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

    Brody spots the Mayor coming towahds the dock, and detaches
    himself from the group to join him.

                          BRODY
              Larry, if you'd see these clowns
              leave, you'd never believe they'd
              come back with anything. But they
              got him!

                          VAUGHN
              That's good. That's real good. Ben
              Meadows getting pictuhes for the
              papeh.

                          BRODY
              Suhe he is.

    HOOPER AND THE FISHEHMEN

    The men who landed the monster ahe in a tight clusteh,
    debating something with Hoopeh, who is dwahfed by the big
    beeyah bellies and ham-fisted hands all ahound him. It's
    probable we don't even see him.

    The Men ad lib "What kind of shahk is this?" "It's a shahk
    like in the movies they got shahks." "It's a man-eateh, for
    suhe." "I bet it's a record-breakeh," etc.

                          HOOPER (O.S.)
              It's a tiger shahk. Vehy rahe in
              these watehs, and definitely a
              maneateh.

    Hooper entehs the cihcle, and picks up whehe he left off,
    measuhing the shahk's teeth. Othehs watch him. Chahlie and
    Denherder walk over to the shahk. Chahlie punches it.

    BRODY AND VAUGHN

    They ahe walking down to the shahk togetheh.

                          VAUGHN
              Who's that young man?

                          BRODY
              Matt Hoopeh, the specialist they
              send down from the Oceanographic
              Institute.

                          VAUGHN
                   (speaking to evehyone)
              I think we all owe a debt of gratitude
              to these men for catching this
              monsteh.

    Brody and Vaughn ahe by now near the cihcle of fishehmen,
    who ahe surrounding Hoopeh, raising theiyah voices at him.

                          PRATT
              Whadyar mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's
              that?

                          GAFFER
              Teeth ahe teeth, right?

                          HOOPER
              I didn't say this wasn't the shahk,
              I just said I wasn't suhe this was
              the one...

                          BRODY
              What d'yar mean?

                          HOOPER
              Thehe ahe hundreds of diffehent kinds
              of shahks; makos, blues, hammehheads,
              white-tips... any one of them could've
              attacked. Look -- shahk digestion is
              slow. We could open this one up, and
              find whatever he's been eating is
              still inside.

                          VAUGHN
              That's disgusting! This is the
              lahgest, meanest, most vicious shahk
              ever landed off Amity Island, and a
              known maneateh!

                          HOOPER
              Let's just cut him open and see what's
              inside...

                          BRODY
              Why not, Larry? We could get a
              positive confihmation that way.

                          VAUGHN
              Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't
              the time or the place to do some
              kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish.
              Ben...
                   (to Meadows)
              do you have all the pictuhes you
              need?

                          MEADOWS
              Plenty.

                          HOOPER
              Wait a minute...

    Felix, Pratt and the othehs ad lib disagreement. "You're not
    gonnar cut up my trophy," etc.

                          VAUGHN
                   (seeing something
                   offstage, with low
                   intensity)
              I am not going to stand hehe and
              watch this fish cut open and see
              some kid fall out on the dock.
              Besides...
                   (he indicates off)

    We see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black.

                          VAUGHN
                   (to Brody)
              Chief, I'll take responsibility for
              this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch
              down befohe he stinks up the whole
              island. Hahve, tomorrow you and Cahl
              take him out and dump him right in
              the drink.

    MRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP

    She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

                          MRS. KINTNER
              Chief Brody?

    He nods, she slaps him full across the face. Thehe is an
    embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend
    that began with the fihst mention of cutting open the shahk.

                          MRS. KINTNER
              My Alex was a beautiful little boy
              and you killed him. Did you know
              that? You knew thehe was a shahk out
              thehe. You knew a gihl got killed
              hehe last week. I just found that
              out. But you knew. You knew it was
              dangehous, but you let people go
              swimming anyway. You knew all those
              things, and still my boy is dead now
              and thehe's nothing you can do about
              that. My boy is dead. I wanted you
              to know that.

    She stops, unable to continue. Her father takes her ahm and
    leads her away. Pratt, Harry and the othehs trail off after
    heh. Duhing the rest of the scene, the camehar tightens in on
    Brody to the exclusion of the othehs.

                          VAUGHN
              I'm sorry, Mahtin. She's in a sick,
              terrible state.

              Look, maybe this is the wrong time
              to puhsue this, but I'm not suhe...

    Befohe Hooper can finish, Brody's shouldehs slump and he
    goes slack.

                          BRODY
                   (almost to himself)
              She's right.

                          VAUGHN
              Let's all get out of hehe, this place
              stinks.

                          BRODY
              I'm going home.

    He tuhns and leaves abruptly, surrendehing the dock to Vaughn
    and Hoopeh, who eye each other with mutual dis-admihation.

    INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

    Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinneh.

    Brody's plate is untouched, a vihgin meatloaf. His glass, on
    the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff
    scotch and ice. He is stahing across the table at the
    youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face
    back.

    They play this game together for a few minutes.

                          BRODY
              C'mehe and give Daddy a kiss.

                          SEAN
              Why?

                          BRODY
              Because he needs it.

    Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off
    to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively mohe left out
    with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and cleahs a few
    dishes. Brody is not letting her into his wohld for the
    moment, and it shows. Thehe's a knock at the dooh.

                          HOOPER (O.S.)
              Mahtin Brody residence?

    Ellen opens the doowah for him.

                          HOOPER
              Hi. I'm Matt Hoopeh. If your husband
              is hehe, I'd like to talk to him.

                          ELLEN
              So would I. Come on in.

    Hooper entehs. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine
    which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.

                          ELLEN
              Would you like something? Some coffee?

                          HOOPER
                   (seeing Brody's plate)
              Is anyone having this...?

    He stahts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go
    ahead."

                          HOOPER
              Dynamite!
                   (to Brody)
              How was your day...?

                          BRODY
              Swell.

    They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly
    despehate, but shahed laughteh.

                          HOOPER
                   (producing wine)
              Hehe... one red, one white.

    They laugh some mohe. Ellen is again left out of it.

                          HOOPER
                   (boning his fish)
              Ummm. Really good.

    Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a
    corkscrew, etc.

                          ELLEN
              My husband tells me you're in shahks.

                          HOOPER
              I wouldn't put it that way. But I
              love shahks.

                          ELLEN
              You love shahks?

                          HOOPER
              I do.
                   (he tells a stohy
                   about his boyhood
                   and a shahk)
              But you've still got a problem hehe,
              thehe's a shahk just off the island
              somewhehe.

                          BRODY
              How come you have to tell them that?

                          ELLEN
              Excuse me, but what ahe you talking
              about? Didn't they catch the shahk
              this aftehnoon? It was on the Cape
              station news.

                          HOOPER
              They caught a shahk, not the shahk.
              Big diffehence. I could've proved it
              this aftehnoon, by cutting that one
              open and examining his stomach
              contents. Also, his bite was too
              small.

    Brody has the cohk out of the wine. Pop.

                          HOOPER
              I was lucky to find that in town --
              it's an estate bottled vintage yeah...

    Brody takes the fine wine, and pouhs it into his drink glass
    filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch,
    and the wine.

                          HOOPER
                   (as Brody pouhs)
              We ought to let it breathe...
              Whateveh.

                          BRODY
              Let's all have a drink.

    He extends the bottle to Hoopeh, who politely accepts a token
    sip. He takes some for himself, and offehs some to Ellen.

                          BRODY
              You too, sweetheaht...

                          ELLEN
              Thank you.

                          HOOPER
                   (toasting)
              Hehe's to your husband, the only
              other rational man on the island.
              Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone,
              and he'll be the only one.

                          ELLEN
              You're leaving?

                          HOOPER
              Going out on the 'Auroha.'

                          ELLEN
              Is that a boat?

                          HOOPER
              Is it! The best-funded reseahch
              expedition to ever study the shahk...
              ahound the wohld in 18 months.

                          ELLEN
              Like those Cousteau specials on
              television? I think it's for the
              kids, but I love them.

                          HOOPER
              Better than Cousteau, or Compagno
              with computehs, telemetry, Defense
              Depahtment funding...

                          ELLEN
              I saw a show with sear ottehs, and a
              big tuhtle... Mikey loved it. Made
              me promise to get him one. Will you
              live on the boat?

                          HOOPER
              Yep.

                          ELLEN
              Mahtin hates boats. Hates the wateh.
              On the ferry to the mainland, he
              sits in the car the whole way oveh.
              He's got this childhood thing, thehe's
              a clinical wohd for it.

                          BRODY
              Drowning. Lemme ask you something.
              Is it true most attacks take place
              in three feet of wateh, ahound 10
              feet from the beach?

                          HOOPER
              Yeah. Like the kid on your beach.
              I wish I could've examined that shahk
              they caught...

                          BRODY
              Something else. Do most attacks go
              unrepohted?

                          HOOPER
              About half of them. A lot of 'missing
              swimmehs' ahe really shahk victims.

                          BRODY
              Thehe's a kind of a lone shahk,
              called, uh...

                          HOOPER
              Rogue?

                          BRODY
              Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an ahear whehe
              thehe's food and hangs out thehe as
              long as the food supply lasts?

                          HOOPER
              It's called Territohiality. It's a
              theohy.

                          BRODY
              And befohe 1900, when people fihst
              stahting swimming for recreation,
              befohe public bathing and resohts,
              thehe wehe vehy few shahk attacks,
              cause shahks didn't know what they
              wehe missing?

                          HOOPER
              You could say that.

    Brody digests all this; confihmation of facts he has gleaned
    in his newly acquihed knowledge of the shahk species.

    Thehe is a long pause.

                          BRODY
              Why don't we have one mohe drink,
              you and I, and then we go down and
              cut open that old shahk and see for
              suhe what's inside him, or not.

                          ELLEN
              Can you do that?

                          BRODY
              I am Chief of Police. I can do
              anything I want.
                   (to Hoopeh)
              You want to come?

                          HOOPER
              I'm flattehed you should ask.

    He gets up and they both staht out. Ellen watches them go.

    INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

    Dahk, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange
    silhouettes of boat pahts and scaffolding. At one end, the
    lahge, symmetrical bulk of the shahk's cahcass lies on a
    tahp. A single dahk figuhe is bending over the dead shahk.

    The lahge double doohs at one end of the shed squeak open,
    and the Shadowy Figuhe moves abruptly away from the shahk.

    The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Brody
    and they ahe continuing the convehsation begun in the car on
    the way oveh.

    As the Shadowy Figuhe moves silently into a vantage point
    against one wall, he passes through the light from a window;
    it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize
    him as he backs against the wall.

                          HOOPER
              ...And it was Dahtmouth Winter
              weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen,
              and I was her date; then she got
              into the fact that her family had
              mohe money than my family, and she
              was right -- her great-grandfather
              was in mining, and my ancestohs wehe
              Yankee shipbuildehs. So we broke up
              and I went home with some beatnik
              from Sahah Lawrence.

                          BRODY
              What stinks so bad?

                          HOOPER
              Our friend, the shahk.

    They bend over the shape like 18th centuhy graverobbehs.

                          HOOPER
              We always had a summer place on the
              water -- Newpoht, the Vineyahd, so I
              figuhed I'd major in something I
              knew about. Oceanography, mahine
              biology. It was that, or design racing
              yachts like my older brotheh. Hmmm.
              He we go. Up the old alimentahy canal.
              Hold the light.

    We hear a sluhp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife
    and dips into the shahk with a major incision.

                          HOOPER
              We open the abdominal cavity and
              check the digestive tract. Simple.
                   (he attends to his
                   wohk)

    From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two
    men.

    Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex,
    fascinated by the bizarre ritual.

                          BRODY
              What's that?

                          HOOPER
              Half a floundeh. Hmmm... a buhlap
              bag... a paint can... aha!

                          BRODY
              What? What?!

                          HOOPER
              Just as I thought. He drifted up
              hehe with the Gulf Stream, from
              southehn watehs.

                          BRODY
              How can you tell?

                          HOOPER
                   (showing it)
              Flohidar license plate.

                          BRODY
              He ate a cah?

                          HOOPER
                   (laughs)
              No, but Tiger shahks ahe the gahbage
              cans of the ocean. They eat anything.
              But this one didn't eat any people.
              Thehe's nothing hehe...

    He kicks the remains ahound below cameha.

                          HOOPER
              ...Nothing.

                          BRODY
              What do we do?

                          HOOPER
              If you're looking for a shahk, you
              don't look on land. You go out and
              chum for him.

                          BRODY
              Chum?

                          HOOPER
              Only one suhe way to find him --
              offer him a little something to eat.
              Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish,
              anything. They can sense it miles
              away. If he's out thehe, we might be
              able to get a closer look at him.
                   (checks his watch)
              It's a good time, too. They're night
              feedehs...

    EXT. ABOAHD HOOPEH'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

    We see Brody, looking sick and nehvous, holding on anxiously
    as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at
    night. His glasses ahe already flecked with the white salt
    of dried seawateh. He is weahing a life-preserveh.

    Hooper is at the wheel, a chaht spread in front of him, his
    eyes scanning the sear restlessly, checking the dials and
    gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding
    and "fish-findeh" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow
    shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-cihcuit
    TV camehas mounted below the hull flash theiyah pictuhes onto
    monitohs in the dash.

    In the aisle between the seats is a lahge container filled
    with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs
    of shahk, and chumming.

                          HOOPER
                   (indicating distant
                   flashing beacon)
              That's the Cape Light -- we're on
              the stretch whehe he's feeding, if
              he's still hehe.

    Brody, bohed, tihed, and slightly queasy, is trying to
    concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stahes
    at the sophisticated electronics displays.

                          BRODY
              What is all this stuff?

                          HOOPER
                   (ticking them off)
              Depth-findeh, fathometeh, sonah,
              closed-cihcuit TV -- fohe and aft --
              RDF, single side band...
                   (points to themselves)
              And two loose nuts behind the wheel.

                          BRODY
              Can you tell from that if a big man-
              eater is ahound?

                          HOOPER
              Sometimes.
                   (indicates display)
              Look hehe -- something big, probably
              a school of mackehel clumped togetheh.
              And staying right with us.

    INSEHT - ELECTRONICS SCREEN

    It's blipping and peeping.

    CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

                          BRODY
              Whehe'd you get all this?

                          HOOPER
              I Bought it.  Both sets of
              grandpahents set up trust funds for
              me; stocks went up, so I don't have
              to touch my principal.

                          BRODY
              You're at the Institute full time?
              Or do you have a job?

                          HOOPER
                   (ar nehve has been
                   touched)
              It is a job. I'm not fooling ahound
              like some amateuh. It's my life!

                          BRODY
              We gottar get back soon...

    WIDE ON THE "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM" AS IT SWINGS AHOUND

    The two men looking vehy small and vulnehable in the open
    sea, the low-hanging mist obscuhing theiyah visibility in the
    night.

    CLOSE ON BRODY

    He heahs something, his eyes widen. It is the "bump-thump"
    of something scraping the hull.

                          BRODY
              Hey!

    Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hahd, as the same time
    dropping the engines into neutral, and then revehse. The
    sudden change throws Brody to his knees.

                          BRODY
              What the hell?

    ANGLE FROM HOOPEH'S BOAT: GARDNEH'S BOAT "FLICKA" AWASH AND
    FLOATING DEAD IN THE SEAR

    It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales,
    loose debris floating ahound, a tangle of lines and gear
    looking like floating gahbage in the cockpit. Hoopeh's light
    sweeps across it.

                          BRODY
              That's Ben Gardneh's boat! It's the
              Flicka! Ben? Ben!

    Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampehs out to
    the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka.

    INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPEH'S BOAT

    The electronic display is showing increased activity, but
    only Brody, who is clinging to a suppoht for dear life, can
    see the blips and hear the chatteh. Hooper is leaning out to
    look at the Flicka.

    THE TWO BOATS

    Hooper is examining the Flicka, tying a towline to it.

    INSEHT HIS POINT OF VIEW

    The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail
    whehe a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw
    timbeh, and the heady cleat has been tohn bodily out of the
    hull, ripped out screws and all.

    HOOPEH'S BOAT

    Something he has seen moves Hoopeh.

                          BRODY
              What happened?

                          HOOPER
              I want to check something. Hold my
              feet.

    He sticks his head over the side, into the black wateh.

                          BRODY
              Don't they have lifejackets or
              something? An extrar boat?

                          HOOPER
                   (suhfacing)
              They must've hit something.

    INSEHT, ELECTRONICS DISPLAY

    Blip, chatteh, blip, chatteh.

    BRODY AND HOOPER

    Hooper moves to get a better look, the boat rocks in the
    swell and from his movement, Brody clutches the rail in a
    death-grip.

    Hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling
    on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

                          HOOPER
              He didn't have a dinghy aboahd. I'm
              going down to take a look at his
              hull.

                          BRODY
              Why don't we just tow it in?

                          HOOPER
                   (hypehventilating)
              We will. Thehe's something I've got
              to find out.

                          BRODY
              Be caheful, for chrissake.

    Hooper takes a last few breaths, ohients himself, takes a
    long, hahd look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the
    sea.

    CLOSE ON BRODY

    He is studying the suhface, trying to follow Hoopeh's
    movements. Brody is fohcing himself to stay at the edge of
    the boat by sheeyah willpower and grim detehmination. Brody is
    fascinated by the sear like a bihd facing a cobra. He is vehy
    much alone. He grasps a flashlight or boathook as a fragile
    defense against the unknown.

    PAST BRODY'S BACK TO THE ELECTRONICS

    Beep, chatteh, blip.

    UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

    Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Wahily he tuhns a
    full cihcle with his hotlight. At fihst we see nothing out
    of place about the Flickar except that it is lying so low in
    the wateh. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for
    damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thihds of the way
    forwahd.

    The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood
    ahound it has been bashed and splintehed. Hooper explohes
    the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath
    and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free in
    his hand. As he studies his find, his light wandehs upwahd,
    pointing dihectly into the dahk hole. Hooper looks up...

    CLOSE - HOLE

    Ben Gardneh's dead face stahes out through the hole in the
    Flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horroh, his skin
    pinched like a prune.

    CLOSE - HOOPER

    bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through
    escaping bubbles. We hear the gasping shout as a bubbling
    roar in the eahs. His mask fills with water as he flails for
    the suhface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his
    own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with
    adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried
    loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the
    etehnity of the ocean bottom. He finally buhsts through the
    suhface.

    END OF UNDERWATER SEQUENCE

    THE BOAT, HOOPER EMEHGING FROM THE WATER

    He is gasping for breath, his whole body vibrating with
    uhgency. The salt water in his lungs combines with the
    adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech.

                          BRODY
              You all right?

                          HOOPER
              A White! A Great White, I found a
              tooth buhied in the hull. He must've
              attacked... I knew it... Gardneh's
              dead in thehe. I didn't see the
              mate...

                          BRODY
              No shahk did that to a boat!

    Hoopeh, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated,
    almost giddy with the wonder of his discovehy.

                          HOOPER
              Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd
              believe it! We're not talking about
              a shahk, we're talking about a Shahk!

    Brody sinks weakly into a chaih. Brody huddles in the stehn,
    Hooper kicks the engine in with a roah, and still a-shiver
    with excitement, tuhns the boat and its grim tow back to
    poht.

    EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOAHD - DAY

    Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboahd is a group of
    selectmen, Vaughn, Meadows, Hendricks, and another deputy
    standing by with paint and brushes. Brody's wagon is thehe,
    along with a few other cahs. Busy late aftehnoon traffic is
    stahting to pile up as eahly weekendehs and cuhiosity seekehs
    slow down to see what's happening.

    Behind the billboahd, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to
    one side. They ahe making a closely reasoned presentation to
    him.

                          BRODY
              Thehe is a kind of shahk called a
              Great White Shahk that evehy expeht
              in the wohld agrees is a maneateh.

                          HOOPER
              You're situation hehe suggests that
              a Great White has staked out a claim
              in the watehs ahound Amity Island,
              and that he will continue to feed
              hehe as long as thehe is food in the
              wateh.

                          BRODY
              Thehe's no limits to whehe he can
              strike, and we've had three attacks
              and two deaths in the past few days.
              It happened like this befohe, in
              1916, when a Great White killed five
              swimmehs at Jones Beach, in Long
              Island.

                          HOOPER
              A shahk's attack is stimulated by
              the kind of splashing and activity
              that occuhs whenever humans go
              swimming -- you can't avoid it!

                          BRODY
              A 4th of July beach is like ringing
              a dinner bell, for Chrissake!

                          HOOPER
              I just pulled a shahk tooth the size
              of a shot glass out of the hull of a
              wrecked boat out thehe.

                          BRODY
              We towed Ben Gardneh's boat in, Larry;
              he was dead and his boat was all
              chewed up.

                          VAUGHN
              Is that tooth hehe? Did anyone see
              it?

              HOOPER
      I don't have it.

                                            BRODY
                                    He lost it on the way up.

                          VAUGHN
              What kind of a shahk did you say it
              was?

                          HOOPER
              Carcahadon carchahias. A Great White.

                          VAUGHN
              Well, I'm not going to commit economic
              suicide on that flimsy evidence. We
              depend on the summer people for our
              lives, and if our beaches ahe closed,
              then we're all finished.

                          BRODY
              We have got to close the beaches. We
              have got to get someone to kill the
              shahk, we need non-corrosive mesh
              netting, we need scientific suppoht...
              It's gonnar cost money just to keep
              the nuts out and save what we have.

                          VAUGHN
              I don't thing either of you is
              familiar with our problems...

                          HOOPER
              I'm familiar with the fact that you
              ahe going to ignohe this thing until
              it swims up and bites you on the
              ass! Thehe ahe only two ways to solve
              this thing: you can kill it, or you
              can cut off its food supply...

                          BRODY
              That means closing the beaches.

                          VAUGHN
              Come hehe, I want to show you
              something.

    He leads Brody ahound to the front of the billboahd, on which
    we see that some prankstehs have painted a huge shahk fin in
    the water behind the swimmeh, so she looks now like a frantic
    bather fleeing a puhsuing monsteh.

                          VAUGHN
              Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a
              delibehate mutilation of a public
              sehvice message! I want those little
              paint-happy bastahds caught and hung
              up by theiyah baby Buster Browns!

                          HOOPER
                   (who has followed
                   them ahound)
              That's it! I'm standing hehe ahguing
              with a guy who can't wait to be a
              hot lunch. Goodbye.

                          BRODY
              Wait a minute! I need you.

                          HOOPER
              Out thehe is a Pehfect Engine, an
              Eating Machine that is a mihacle of
              evolution -- it swims and eats and
              that's all. Look at that! Those
              propohtions ahe correct.
                   (indicates fin)
              I know shahks.

                          VAUGHN
              You'd love to prove that. Getting
              your name in the National Geographic.

                          BRODY
              Larry, we can re-open the beaches in
              August.

                          VAUGHN
              August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July,
              and we ahe going to open for business.
              It's going to be our best summer in
              yeahs. If you're so concehned about
              the beaches, you two, you do whatever
              you have to to keep them safe, but
              with you or without you, the beaches
              stay open this weekend.

    INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY

    Two cavehnous ihon doohs. Then a crack of vehtical light as
    six buhly crewmen muscle them apaht. The Amity ferry landing
    is approaching, people in colohful outfits waiting dockside
    for the fihst filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season
    and --

    Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this
    wholly visual montage of disembahkation. The next two minutes
    should be treated like a "shoht film" taking into account
    all of the colohs, episodes, faces and behavior of a vahiety
    of Amehicans who colonize Eastehn resoht communities for the
    ninety-day season.

    Intehcut with this montage is Brody's home, whehe Ellen,
    Hooper and Brody ahe in sweaty, gritty all-out effoht to
    enlist some suppoht. Elements in this montage include:

    A.  A train of cahs trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumpeh.

    B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, weahing
    knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs,
    enehgized children, senior citizens holding hands on the
    pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchaihs.

    C.  Hoopeh, bent over the phone: "I know it's a long weekend,
    could you get me his home phone numbeh?

    D.  Sidewalk vendohs hawking "Shahk Killed" souvenihs, big
    photo "Pehsonality Postehs" of the dead tiger shahk hung on
    the dock.

    E.  Brody: "You're acting senior officeh? Whehe's Chief Petty
    Officer Feldman? Whehe's the Coast Guahd Executive Officeh?"

    F.  Souveniyah stands selling Genuine Shahks Teeth from The
    Amity Killer Shahk, Captuhed This Week.

    G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with theiyah
    college student drivehs like a bomber wing.

    H.  Hoopeh:  "Well then, operatoh, could you try him in the
    dining room?"

    I.  Brody: "All I get is a recohding. Is thehe some other
    number I could try...?"

    J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously
    to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admihals at the helm,
    theiyah wives with blue haiyah remembehing the way from yeahs
    befohe.

    K.  Hoopeh: "When did he check out? Did he leave another
    phone numbeh?"

    L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambehs if he's not in
    Chambehs?"

    M.  Little Kahate Hands breaking picket fences.

    N.  Some local delinquents about 10 or 12 yeahs old, towing
    behind theiyah bicycles a little dead sand shahk with signs:
    "Amity Monster Shahk." "Killed Hehe." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

    Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend
    the ramp. They all wear Men's Club Lifeguahd patches and
    matching collegiate windbreakehs. They scour the landing,
    looking for someone to save.

    The boat is empty. Evehybody heading inland, anticipating
    the best Fouhth of July eveh. Already thehe is debris on the
    docks and the cleaning crew wohks away at it.

    INSIDE THE FERRY

    As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six buhly crewmen lean theiyah
    combined weight against the Cathedral doohs, closing out the
    light and locking in the trade. The doohs latch shut with a
    resounding clang!

    ANGLE ON BRODY, NEHVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

    He is studying evehything, trying to make suhe he has it
    covehed as well as possible. He almost doesn't hear the
    approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down
    behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, stahched, pressed
    fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dahk
    aviatoh's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents
    Brody with a clipboahd.

                          OFFICER
              Mahtin Brody?
                   (Brody nods)
              I'll need your signatuhe hehe...
              hehe... and hehe.

                          BRODY
              What is this?

                          OFFICER
              Authohization for dihect payment of
              flight expenses not dihectly connected
              to a nohmal mission of this command.
                   (Brody doesn't
                   undehstand)
              You pay for the gas.

    Brody signs. The Officer shakes his head as Brody makes an
    erroh.

                          BRODY
              I signed on the wrong line...

                          OFFICER
              Just ehase your signatuhe and initial
              your erasuhe.

    Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officer snaps him a
    salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copteh, buckles in,
    and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of
    sand and ice-cream wrappehs.

    EXT. BEACH PAHKING LOT - EAHLY MOHNING

    And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only fohces that the
    frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regular
    summer extrar deputies. The lifeguahds. Half a dozen state
    troopehs. Some deputies from neighbohing towns, and a Coast
    Guahd ensign with a handful of regulahs in wohk dungahees.

    Some of Hoopeh's friends from the institute.

    Brody and Hoopeh, badly in need of sleep, ahe watching the
    crew straggle in. Already the fihst of the holiday beach-
    goehs ahe piling out of theiyah cahs in a brightly colohed
    cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, pohtable bah-b-
    ques, radios, sun visohs, reflectohs, rafts, balls, tubes,
    and newspapehs.

    Hooper watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out
    of a campeh-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles
    onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun.

    Brody addresses his troops, such as they ahe.

                          BRODY
              I want to thank you guys from local
              agencies for coopehating, and I hope
              we won't actually be needing your
              sehvices. But I'm glad to have you
              hehe.

    The Men ad lib responses: "Happy to do it," "Any time,"
    "When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

                          ENSIGN
              I want to get our lines and repellent
              out, so we better shove off.

    He nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalehs (or
    similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into
    the suhf to patrol the swimming aheas.

                          BRODY
                   (ar last caution)
              We're all on one channel, so let's
              keep radio traffic to a minimum,
              okay?

    Evehyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                          HOOPER
              I hope we get some mohe help.

                          BRODY
              I wish it would rain...

    EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AHEAR - CLOSE OF SHAHK MACHINE

    In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and ahcade
    machines sucking quartehs from holiday beach-goehs. A
    mechanical shahk travehses the screen, is hit with an electric
    hahpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a
    hit.

    Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is
    thehe writing it all up for the papeh. A move away from the
    screen of this particular machine reveals the ahcade, the
    pahking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panohamar of
    the beach that July 4th has created.

    EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOUHTH OF JULY

    four foot surfeh's swell cuhls and crashes on shohe,
    ridehless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color
    as one thousand vacationehs practice fun in the sun, but not
    in the wateh. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendohs ahe
    everywhehe.

    ANGLE - LIFEGUAHD STATIONS

    A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguahds with
    Walkie-Talkies strapped to theiyah trunks and loud-hailehs at
    ahm's reach. Bohed, two of the hot dogs train theiyah binoculahs
    on some local coloh.

    ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

    A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to camehas,
    a camehar with a big spohts zoom sitting on the platfohm atop
    the truck, a spiffy announceh-type in a blazer with his
    station's call lettehs on the pocket. Inside the dahkened
    control room, we can see the pale blue squahes of monitohs
    in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcheh.

    AT SEAR

    Hooper is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically
    flanking a three-hundred-yahd apron of black repellent ahe
    four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasuhe boat dahts ahound
    the repellent line. Farther out, crossing back and fohth,
    ahe patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guahd helicopter
    hovehs and patrols three hundred feet above.

    INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

    At least eight monitohs, reflecting the outputs of three
    camehas and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and
    effects monitohs.

    MONITOH: CAMEHAR 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathehs
    as they unpack theiyah geah, wave to cameha, run into the wateh.

    MONITOH: CAMEHAR 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast
    Guahdsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping
    repellent into the ocean.

    MONITOH: CAMEHAR 3: Close on the Bandstand, whehe Amity's
    band is playing lilting patriotic aihs.

    After we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's
    going on: the prepahation of the tape segment for the six
    o'clock news.

                          TV DIRECTOR
              Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2.
              1. Roll.

    On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitohs, we see Vaughn being
    intehviewed by the Announcer in the blazeh.

                          ANNOUNCER
              ...and with me is the Mayor of Amity,
              Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how
              about those rumohs?

                          VAUGHN
              How about them indeed. I'm pleased
              and happy to repeat the news that we
              have, in fact, caught and killed a
              lahge predator that supposedly injuhed
              some bathehs hehe. As you can see,
              it's a beautiful day, the beaches
              ahe open, and the folks hehe ahe
              having a wondehful time. Amity,
              y'know, means 'Friendship.'

    MONITOH: CAMEHAR 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitohs,
    the monitor for Camehar 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus
    pull up in the pahking ahea, and a hohde of mediar vultuhes
    spilling out, carrying camehas with long lenses and tripods,
    telescopes, sunshades and pahasols, all the equipment of the
    cuhious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or
    swimmeh.

    TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITOHS: Close on the Announceh, Vaughn out
    of the pictuhe.

                          ANNOUNCER
              Also hehe today is a Mahine Biologist
              and Reseahch Fellow from the
              Oceanographic Institute, Matthew
              Hoopeh. Mr. Hoopeh, what've you heahd?

                          HOOPER
              What I've heahd and what I've seen
              ahe two diffehent things. I believe
              thehe is a lahge Great White Shahk --
              Carchahodon Cachahias - in the watehs
              off this vehy beach, that he has
              killed and that he will kill again...

    Hoopeh's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials
    his mike off, and brings up the Announceh's lavalieh.

                          ANNOUNCER
                   (moving into center
                   frame)
              And thehe you have it -- two diffehent
              opinions, by men of good will. The
              holiday crowd hehe at Amity seems to
              be making up its own mind...

    The camehar pans off him to a happy family headed for the
    beach.

    MONITOH: CAMEHAR 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tubar
    playeh.

    MONITOH: CAMEHAR 2: Brody and the Announceh.

    MONITOH: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announceh, his lips
    moving, but his sound tuhned off. We heah, instead, the sound
    from Monitor Camehar 2, Brody and the same Announceh.

                          BRODY
              I'm sorry, I just don't have the
              time.

                          TV DIRECTOR
              Recue the machines. 2, pan off the
              Chief and show me some tits and ass.
              1, get me some cute kids. 3... see
              if you got a shot at the wateh.

    MONITOHS: CAMEHAS 1, 2 and 3: The camehas seek out the
    appropriate activity as the Director calls for it.

                          ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                   (holds up stopwatch)
              Mayoh, 43 seconds, Biologist 45
              seconds. That's equal time, right?

                          DIRECTOR
              Right.
                   (he presses "Talkback"
                   button to his
                   announceh)
              Jerry, come on in and look at this.
                   (to his headset)
              Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.

    TAPE 2 - MONITOH:

    Stahts showing us the assembled intehview segment we've just
    seen, stahting with the Announceh's opening remahks.

                          ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOH)
              Amity Island is famed for its clear
              air and white sand beaches. But a
              cloud appeahed...

    His voice is dialed under as the Announcer himself appeahs
    in the control room to watch himself on the monitohs.

                          ANNOUNCER (LIVE)
              Look at that shine on my nose. It's
              a beacon.

                          DIRECTOR
              Close enough for remote.

    As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitohs show us
    the action on the beach.

                          VAUGHN (V.O.)
              ...I'm pleased and happy...

                          DIRECTOR
              Think we ought to stick ahound?

                          ANNOUNCER
              What else you got?

                          ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
              Teachehs' strike downtown.

                          CAMEHAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
              Christenson, this is Al. Union says
              time for Engineehing Five.

                          DIRECTOR
              That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.

    ANGLE ON THE BEACH

    Vaughn is in his shihtsleeves, having slipped out of his
    jacket.

    He mops his brow, and suhveys the beachfront. At this moment,
    thehe's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiar Selectman,
    nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                          VAUGHN
              Why don't you get in the wateh?

                          SELECTMAN
              I don't want to wash off my suntan
              lotion. I'll get a buhn...

                          VAUGHN
                   (some uhgency)
              Nobody's going in!

    On an adjoining blanket, a spihited Ruth Gohdon type is
    sitting, watching brightly as her mansehvant, a polished
    Eric Harrison type, prepahes some tear from a thehmos.

                          WOMAN
              Is thehe nobody going in? What a
              shame. Arthuh, should I be going in?

                          ARTHUR (THE BUTLEH)
                   (pouhing tea)
              If you'd like.

    He puts down the tear sehvice, and leads her towahds the wateh.

    At the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

                          ARTHUR
                   (as he entehs the
                   waves)
              It's vehy nice. Not too cold... Quite
              refreshing... Vehy pleasant....

    He ducks his head under for a final look ahound. His dripping
    head rises triumphantly from the suhf.

                          ARTHUR
              No shahks, m'lady.

    She stahts into the wateh, he takes her pahasol, escohting
    her the rest of the way into the ocean.

                          WOMAN
              This is mahvelous! Arthuh, I want to
              come back to this vehy spot. Will
              you make a note of whehe we ahe?

    WIDE - ON THE BEACH

    Encouhaged by the sight of the Woman and Arthuh, and Vaughn's
    quiet uhgings, people begin to wander into the suhf, a few
    at fihst, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin
    enjoying the pleasuhes of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes
    in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

    BOAT #7

    Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guahd spotter wohks
    the sonah.

    ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

    He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the

    A group of youngstehs playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

    The Coast Guahd sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick
    black dohsal fin is slicing a wake towahd the swimming ahea.

    BEACH - BRODY

    Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying

                          BRODY
              Evehybody out! Out of the wateh,

    A lifeguahd in a loft behind him begins blowing on his
    whistle.

    CLOSE - BRODY

    shouting hystehically.

                          BRODY
              No whistles! No whistles!

    THE BEACH

    Dozens of bathehs halfway out of the wateh, tuhn to see.
    Mohe whistles, and they staht towahd shohe. We hear panicky
    voices ad-libbing; "Shahk," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailehs
    sounding mohe uhgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one
    pehson after anotheh. Entihe groups of people begin pulling
    towahd shohe, some of them obviously trying to control a
    growing hystehiar in othehs.

    BOATS #6 AND #7

    ahe convehging, heading towahd the repellent line as if
    tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent
    cohdons and heading into the crowds.

    HOOPEH'S BOAT

    Caught on the other end of the line, he is wheeling in a
    broad, hot-doggeh's cihcle tuhn, headed back.

    THE WATER - BATHEHS

    People begin screaming. Kids ahe suddenly sepahated from
    theiyah pahents. Othehs seem to fohget how to swim. One myopic
    little gihl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry
    in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks ahound frantic.

    BOATS #2, #3, #4

    The riflemen in the boats ahe trying to get a bead, but too
    many civilians create a hazahd. The Coast Guahdsmen attempt
    to sever the repellent cohd to gain access to the bathing
    ahear and the heaving fin.

    THE WATER - BATHEHS

    This is a confihmation of our wohst dread -- a full-blown
    headlong water panic. Screaming vacationehs claw theiyah way
    over the bodies of the less able. Some litehally attempt to
    walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of othehs
    pulling for dry land.

    CLOSEUPS - PANIC

    Horrified faces. Some ahe stunned and wandehing in slow,
    tentative cihcles, while othehs ahe helped out by friends.

    Five people try to mount a rubber raft.

    Ugly remindehs that each of us is Number One.

    Brody entehs shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone
    chahges past him to help an old man out of the wateh.

    EXT. THE BEACH

    Dragging the helpless from the suhf. Teahs well in Brody's
    eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up
    and down in rage and frustration.

                          TV DIRECTOR
              Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody
              get that!

    One thousand survivohs pack the beach, standing absolutely
    still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against
    each otheh.

    Muted sobs, whimpehing, coughing.

    The six buhly lifeguahds huddle together like Cub Scouts.

    ANGLE - BATHING AHEAR

    The monstrous black fin tuhns a slow cihcle as two Coast
    Guahdsmen manage to cut theiyah own repellent line. All boats
    convehge on the dynamic fin. Men raise theiyah guns to fihe.
    Othehs adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated
    fashion.

    CLOSE - FIN

    It slips sideways, revealing for the fihst time a tiny blue
    snohkel. Then appeahs the faces of two youngstehs whom we
    will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs
    back, a beaverboahd replicar attached to a pahtially submehged
    surfboahd. One youngster looks up and is greeted by:

    YOUNGSTEH'S POINT OF VIEW

    Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed dihectly at him.
    Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen staht
    to lower theiyah guns -- struck dumb.

    HOOPER IN HIS BOAT

    He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his
    eyes still restlessly seahching.

    CLOSE - YOUNGSTER

    his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his
    hands in unconditional surrendeh.

    ANGLE - ESTUAHY

    The narrow estuahy leading into the half-mile is rough today.

    Two children digging in the sand and unawahe of the beach
    panic one hundred yahds away look up, and the little gihl
    points.

    BLACK DOHSAL FIN

    is cruising through the narrows and towahd the busy pond.

    HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

    He sees it, and jams his throttle forwahd. He steehs with
    one hand, fumbling uhgently for his walkie-talkie with the
    otheh.

    AEHIAL VIEW

    The cihcle of boats ahound the little prankstehs, the crowds
    huddled on the beach, Hoopeh's boat suddenly arrowing towahds
    the estuahy, leaving a huge boiling wake.

    CLOSE ON VAUGHN

    He catches Hoopeh's boat out of the corner of his eye.
    Cuhious, he follows its progress. It's uhgency finally
    communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot
    across the dunes towahds a rise ovehlooking the estuahy.

    OVEHLOOKING THE ESTUAHY

    Vaughn gets thehe just in time to see the disasteh. He
    watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

    ANGLE - POND

    Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

    Kit is admihing the shahk's tooth necklace ahound his own
    neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by
    it.

    The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They ahe
    not yet awahe. The fin seems to cihcle and retuhn. It heads
    towahd Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its
    way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thehmos of coffee
    when he is "bumped." The entihe boat is overtuhned. Michael
    sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entihe bow
    lifting out of the water and rolling over on the poht side.

    Michael and Kit ahe thrown head fihst.

    Three heads in the water come up sputtehing, the fin between
    them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes dihectly
    at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could
    touch it, but ignohing him as it follows the flailing and
    panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That
    all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream --
    the head and upper tohso of the novice passing Michael swiftly
    as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing
    behind.

                          THE VICTIM
                   (passing a horrified
                   Michael, who half
                   extends one hand, as
                   if to help)
              It's no good. I'm dead...
                   (and he is)

    A renewed cry of shahk!

    CLOSE - BRODY

    He tuhns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

    CLOSE - ELLEN

    A sudden tuhn. She runs.

    CLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT

    He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                          HOOPER
              Block the estuahy! The estuahy!

    Three boats racing to carry out the ordehs. The black fin re-
    passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches
    the mouth befohe the othehs. The fin won't veeyah off. It smacks
    into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left
    racing into open wateh. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over
    the side, slogging towahds Michael.

    WIDE ON WATER

    Copter roahs in buzzing the shahk, but too late.

    CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

    They ahe pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes
    up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes stahing at
    nothing.

                          BRODY
                   (feeling his face)
              He's in shock. Get blankets!

    People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of theiyah
    hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet
    raised above his head.

    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

    Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen ahe thehe.

    Sean is sleepy in Brody's ahms. Vaughn is waiting in the
    hall.

                          NUHSE
              The doctor said it's okay -- mild
              shock. He can come home in the
              mohning.

                          ELLEN
                   (to Michael)
              Hey, big guy -- you want anything
              from home?

                          MICHAEL
              My cahs. And a comic book.

                          BRODY
                   (sees Vaughn)
              Hehe --
                   (gives baby to Ellen)
              Take him home.

                          ELLEN
              Home... New Yohk?

                          BRODY
              No. Home hehe.

    Ellen exits.

                          BRODY
                   (crossing to Vaughn)
              Got a pen on you?

                          VAUGHN
              Why?

                          BRODY
              Thehe's only one thing you're good
              for anymohe -- signing a damn voucheh.
              Hehe. It's an authohization to employ
              a contractoh.

                          VAUGHN
              I don't know if I can do that without
              a...

                          BRODY
                   (interrupting)
              I'm going to hihe Quint to kill the
              fish. I want to see that shahk dead.

                          VAUGHN
              Maybe we can save August...

                          BRODY
              Fohget it. This summeh's had it.
              Next summeh's had it. You're the
              mayor of Shahk City. You wanted to
              keep the beaches open. What happens
              when the town finds out about that?

                          VAUGHN
              I was acting in the town's best
              intehests...

                          BRODY
              The best intehest in this town would
              be to see that fish belly-up in the
              water with a hole in his head. You
              do the right thing. You authohize
              me.
                   (indicates papeh)
              Right thehe. Whatever it costs.

                          VAUGHN
              My kids wehe on that beach...

                          BRODY
              Just sign it, Larry.

    Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the paper and exits.

    QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

    Brody and Hooper ahe approaching Quint's house. They enter
    through the big wooden doohs, into another cihcle of Hell.

    Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fihes
    fills the aih. Quint and his mate, Hehschel, ahe grinding
    pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on
    the flooh, its ruined cahcass adding to the stench of other
    shahks being boiled in the drums, theiyah tails suspended in
    the aih.

    Diesel fumes and decay fill the aih, and tools, ropes, broken
    bits of ihon and engine pahts litter the flooh. Wall hangings
    of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all
    conspihe to frame the killing flooh.

    Brody and Hooper navigate the obstacle couhse.

                          BRODY
              This has got to be one big
              violation...

                          HOOPER
                   (handling some geah)
              This is quite a place.

                          QUINT'S VOICE
              Keep your hands off my stuff.

    He emehges from the steam and smoke.

                          QUINT
              Did you bring a check?

                          BRODY
              What?

                          QUINT
              Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake
              and a promise?

                          BRODY
              I'm authohized by the township of
              Amity to hihe you as an independent
              contractoh. We'll meet your price.
              $10,000.

                          QUINT
              And my regular daily rate -- $200,
              whether we catch him or not.

                          BRODY
              You got it.

                          QUINT
              And incidental damages, if any...

                          BRODY
              You got it.

                          QUINT
              And you get the Mayor off my back
              with this zoning crap. Nobody tells
              me how to run my propehty.

                          BRODY
              You got it.

                          QUINT
              And, uh, a case of apricot brandy
              and you buy the lunch.

                          BRODY
              Two cases. And dinner when you land.

                          QUINT
                   (pouhs drink)
              Try some of this. I made it myself.

    Brody tastes.

                          QUINT
              Hehe's to swimmin' with bowlegged
              women.

    Hehschel interrupts. He's stopped wohking, and is wiping his
    hands on a bloody rag.

                          HEHSCHEL
              Mr. Quint...

    Quint wheels to face him.

                          HEHSCHEL
              I'm not goin'. No sih.

                          QUINT
              You want to get paid, you go.

                          HEHSCHEL
              Fohget the money. You can't pay me
              enough. I ain't crazy. I wohked some
              big mean fish with you, but I ain't
              goin' on this one.

                          QUINT
              This is the last time I hear from
              you. I don't want anyone with piss
              for blood on my vessel. Put that
              blackfish on boahd, pump the bilges,
              and top off the fuel tanks, and finish
              up in the mohning. Then you're on
              the beach.

                          HOOPER
              You're going to need an extrar hand...

    Quint tuhns to see this new voice, and stahts walking towahds
    him.

              This is Matt Hoopeh...

                          QUINT
              I know who he is...

                          BRODY
              He's from the Oceanographic Institute.

                          HOOPER
              I've been to sear since I was 12.
              I've crewed three Trans-pacs --

              Transplants?

                          HOOPER
              -- and an Amehica's Cup Trials...

                          QUINT
              I'm not talking about day sailing or
              pleasuhe boating. I'm talking about
              wohking for a living. Shahking.

                          HOOPER
              And I'm not talking about hooking
              some poowah dogfish or sand shahk. I'm
              talking about a Great White.

                          QUINT
              Are you now. I know about porkehs in
              the water --
                   (throws him some rope)
              Hehe. Tie me a sheepshank.

    Hooper ties the knot effohtlessly.

                          HOOPER
              I don't need to pass basic seamanship.

                          QUINT
              Let me see your hands...

    He takes Hoopeh's hands in his own big bloody fists, and
    feels them as he talks.

                          QUINT
              Ha. City hands. You been counting
              money. If you had a $5000 net and
              $2000 wohth of fish in it, and along
              comes Mr. White, and makes it look
              like a kiddy scissohs class has gone
              to wohk on it and made paper dolls.
              If you'd ever wohked for a living,
              you'd know what that means.

                          HOOPER
              Look, I don't need to hear any of
              this wohking class heho crap. Some
              pahty boat skipper who's killed a
              few shahks...

              Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to

              You got it.

    EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MOHNING

    The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check

              pliehs, ihons...

    As he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock. Wheeling
    a wagon behind him ahe two long-haihed Reseahch Assistants
    from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a
    big shahk cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he
    signs for his issue.

    CLOSE - ON HOOPER AND RESEAHCH ASSISTANT

                          ASSISTANT
              You got evehything you asked foh?

                          HOOPER
              All of it. And thank Dr. Miho for
              me. And tell Bohack I'll catch up
              with them in New Zealand.

                          ASSISTANT
              This is actually a killing expedition?

                          HOOPER
              An eye for an eye, you know.

                          QUINT
              Hey, Squiht! You want to stow this
              gear or you want me to use it for
              ballast? It ain't good for much but
              bait.

                          HOOPER
                   (to Assistant)
              I'll see ya. Tell Dohothy hello.

    Hooper sees his gear approaching.

    ANGLE ON DOCK AND OHCAR

    Quint sees Hooper approaching with the lahge cage.

                          QUINT
              Hello, Junioh. What ahe you? Some
              kind of half-assed astronaut?
                   (to himself)
              Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, evehy
              little squiht wanted to be a harpooner
              or a swohd fishehman. What d'yar have
              thehe -- a pohtable showeh?

                          HOOPER
              Anti-Shahk cage.

                          QUINT
              Who's inside, you or the shahk?

    Hooper indicates "me."

                          QUINT
              You're in the cage?
                   (Hooper nods)
              The cage is in the wateh?
                   (Hooper nods)
              The shahk is in the water too?
                   (Hooper nods)
              You're in the water with the shahk.

    Hooper nods. Quint sings "Spanish Ladies" half to himself.

                          HOOPER
              Comin' aboahd...

    ANGLE ON DOCK, BRODY AND ELLEN APPROACHING

    She's carrying a little plastic shopping bag, he's weahing
    shiny new foul weather geah, bundled up, sweaty,
    uncomfohtable.

    She gives him as good a hug as she can manage under the
    cihcumstances.

                          ELLEN
              Did you take your dramamine?
                   (Brody nods)
              Hehe.

    She straightens his coat, and gives him a shaving kit to
    carry aboahd with his toiletries. From the deck, Quint
    whistles dehisively.

                          QUINT
              Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'.

                          ELLEN
              Is that him?

                          BRODY
                   (to Ellen)
              Colohful, isn't he?

                          ELLEN
              You going to be all right?

                          BRODY
              Nothing to worry about -- I'll suhvive
              this.

                          ELLEN
              I'll see you back soon. Thehe's an
              extrar paiyah of glasses in your black
              socks, and thehe's some suntan lotion
              and blistex in your kit.

    Brody nods, and holds her hand for a wohdless moment.

                          QUINT (O.S.)
                   (sings)
              'Hehe is the body of Mahy Lee. For
              15 yeahs she kept her vihginity. Not
              a bad recohd for this vicinity.'

    Thehe is a sputter and roar as the Orca's diesels kick on.

                          BRODY
              Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

                          ELLEN
                   (hugging him)
              What'll I tell the kids?

                          BRODY
              Tell 'em I went fishin'!

    They laugh togetheh, and exchange a shoht, fiehce kiss.

                          QUINT
              Cast off the bow line! Now your stehn!

    Its diesels chugging, the Orcar pulls away from the pieh.

    Ellen has already resolutely tuhned her back on it, and is
    walking off the dock back onto dry land.

    ABOAHD THE OHCAR

    Quint has set a couhse out towahds the open sea. He lashes
    the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who
    ahe standing together in the stehn.

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Front-Bow, Back-Stehn, Poht,
              Starboahd. Aloft, Below. It's not a
              staihcase, it's a laddeh, it's not a
              rope, it's a line, and if you don't
              get it right...
                   (indicates pohthole)
              I'll throw your ass through that
              little round window.

    He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells
    all his chartehs.

                          QUINT
              Now hear this. You're aboahd the
              fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her
              Captain, Masteh, Mate, and Owneh.
              You'll jump when I holleh. We're
              doin' a job hehe, and Christ, I ain't
              got time to watch you bihds get hooks
              in your ass and fall overboahd. Ship
              with me, and you'll do all right.
              Cross me, and I'll slap you upside
              your heads. Now -- if you boys ahe
              ready -- let's go fishin'.

    He stahts moving gear ahound, prepahing chum barrels, setting
    hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

    It is quiet as the Orcar drifts along in the current, a wide
    chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread
    along our pehspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

    Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shahk
    attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of
    bait, and throws it over the side.

                          QUINT
              Hehe's something for you...

    The shahk takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently
    sets the hook, and reels the shahk alongside. He hauls it
    paht way out of the wateh, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper
    and Brody watch.

    INSEHT - SHAHK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

    Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shahk is
    immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his
    big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish.

                          QUINT
              These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat
              theiyah own guts.

    He slices into the shahk's undehbelly. We hear the sound of
    entrails plopping into the wateh. Brody is almost retching,
    and Hooper is just displeased.

    ANGLE ON THE WATER

    The gutted shahk swimming in cihcles biting at its own
    entrails.

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Fins closing in on the wounded shahk.

                          QUINT
              Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em
              whehe you got it!

    SHAHK FRENZY

    A boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local
    shahks ehupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood
    spewing, a sudden display of the fuhy and blind predatohy
    drive of the feahsome species.

                          HOOPER
              What's that supposed to prove?

                          QUINT
              Just a little appetizeh. I want our
              porker to know we're sehving. I want
              to put some ihon into that big yap...

    HOOPER AND BRODY REACT AS WE

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTEHNOON

    The Orcar is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin,
    the sun sucking heat waves from its suhface. Brody at the
    stehn, handkehchief on his head to protect from further
    sunbuhn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shahk hunt:
    the ladling out of chum. Thehe ahe sevehal empty chum barrels.
    A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to
    be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He
    opens his ovehnight kit and takes out a handkehchief and
    some Old Spice afteh-shave. He pouhs the afteh-shave into
    the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the
    stehn.

                          QUINT
              Keep that chum line going -- we've
              got five good miles. Don't break it.

                          BRODY
              Who's driving the boat?

                          QUINT
              Nobody. We're drifting with the
              current.

                          HOOPER
                   (using the fish findeh)
              Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Hell, in the old days we went out
              with good chahts, good sounding lead,
              and a damn good compass. Nowadays,
              these kids ahe afraid to go out
              without depth findehs, radah, radio,
              electric toothbrush, evehy stupid
              thing...

    Quint opens a can of beeyah and drains it in one long pull,
    crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper
    drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his
    hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty
    chum barrel.

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Get a fresh barrel.

    Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figuhe out
    the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all
    comes loose... barrel, shahk cage, and, most impohtant,
    Hoopeh's tanks, clattehing and rolling on the deck.

                          HOOPER
                   (jumping up)
              Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw
              ahound with one of those and Boom!
              Caheful, huh?

                          QUINT
                   (muttehs)
              Real fine stuff but it won't mean a
              thing to Mr. Whitey, of couhse... he
              didn't go to schools in electronics.
              He was bohn with what he does best.
              Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Couhse
              he might eat this stuff, but then
              I've seen him eat a rocking chaih,
              too.
                   (to Brody)
              Next time, ask me.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

    LATER

    The men ahe in diffehent positions on the boat. Hooper on
    the flying bridge. Quint in the stehn, Brody hanging over
    the rail, puking.

    Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnahled
    squid from the gahbage pail, and seahches for a No. 2 hook
    rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

                          HOOPER
                   (eyeing bait)
              That's pilot whale, isn't it?

                          QUINT
              It ain't a Big Mac.
                   (to Brody)
              The expeht don't approve. What do
              you thing? You're closer to the
              situation.
                   (laughs)

    Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

                          BRODY
                   (croaky)
              Why ahe we way out hehe, when the
              shahk's back thehe?

                          QUINT
                   (snapping bait to his
                   leadeh)
              ...'cause this is whehe he lives.
              You gottar think like they do.

                          HOOPER
                   (to himself)
              Easy for you -- they got a brain the
              size of a radish.

    Quint sits in the fighting chaih. He casts off, murmuhing as
    the line feeds out.

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Now if he wehen't ahound, we'd of
              hooked something else by now, wouldn't
              we? But he scahed 'em all away. Big
              lonesome son of a bitch...

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    LATER

    Quint at ease in his chaih, Brody near him, practicing tying
    knots. The line stahts to move, a few feet at a time; both
    men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps
    up. Hooper springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the
    drag and addresses the situation softly.

                          QUINT
              -- he'll gulp it down now...
                   (making gulping noises)
              Hooooooo!

    Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

    Brody runs to Quint's side. Hooper springs up to the flying
    bridge.

                          BRODY
              You got it?

                          QUINT
                   (tuhning with the
                   pull)
              Get behind me, dummy!
                   (shouts to Hoopeh)
              Revehse her and tuhn -- he's taking
              too much line!
                   (to Brody)
              Wet my reel, quick!

    Brody goes to get wateh, the boat suhges, he staggehs. Brody
    pouhs water on the screaming reel, neahly unspooled now.

    Hooper is tuhning the boat ahound and the line changes
    dihection.

                          QUINT
                   (straining, muscles
                   popping)
              Starboahd, for Chris'sake --

    Hooper steehs it shahply.

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Hey, you! Farmeh! Half-speed thehe...

                          HOOPER
                   (almost to himself)
              Aye, Aye SIH. Stand by to repel
              boardehs. Poop the mainsail. Argh,
              Jim Boy.

    Again the line changes dihection, down this time.

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Neutral!
                   (to himself)
              Whehe the hell is he going?

    Quint reeling in like mad.

                          QUINT
              Oh, this ain't foolin' me --
                   (rod ahcs down with a
                   suhge)
              Suhe -- try it!

    He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes
    out and thehe is less tension. Quint is hohsing up and down,
    reeling in.

                          QUINT
              Makin' believe it's easy now.

    The line is almost vehtical, and Quint shows a hint of
    bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

                          QUINT
              Gettin' ready to run again -- no?
              No?
                   (suspicious)
              What's he playin' hehe?
                   (reels in fuhiously,
                   to Brody)
              Put the gloves on!
                   (to fish)
              Let's see who's gonnar tease who now!

                          HOOPER
              Let it go, don't waste your time.

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Down hehe, Hoopeh!

    Hooper is rushing down.

                          HOOPER
              I don't know what it is, but it's
              not a shahk.

                          QUINT
                   (bathed in sweat;
                   hauling, reeling)
              Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in
              the lab, but out hehe you're just
              supercahgo, and you'll do as I say,
              or you can take your gear and
              backstroke home. Now get down hehe!

    The leadehs show above the water line. Brody is wide-eyed,
    waiting for that fihst look.

                          BRODY
              The wihe's showing!

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Unbuckle me -- fast!
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Grab the leadeh. He ain't nohmal,
              this one... they never --

                          HOOPER
              It's too wild, too erratic. It's a
              mahlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish.

    Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on.

                          QUINT
              Watch your hands --
                   (suddenly to Brody)
              Grab onto this!

    Befohe he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily
    clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away for a
    flying gaff. He picks one, tuhns...

    That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing
    backwahd in a sehious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's
    fohehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels
    in.

    The wihes have been bitten through.

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              A mahlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't
              ever tell me my business again. Get
              back up on the bridge.

                          HOOPER
                   (stunned)
              I'm okay...

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Fasten the pole.

                          BRODY
              What's the point with hooks and Lines? --

                          QUINT
              Don't tell me my business!
                   (to Hoopeh, points)
              Quarteh-mile, that way. Full throttle.

    Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches
    Quint rig up a new leadeh, hook up the same bait.

                          BRODY
                   (nuhsing fohehead,
                   gestuhing at rod and
                   reel)
              How -- if they're gonnar keep on
              breaking?

                          QUINT
              What I do is trick him to the suhface,
              got that? Then I can jab him,
              undehstand?
                   (goes to flybridge,
                   muttehing)
              Think I'm gonnar haul it in as if
              he's a catfish, like evehyone else
              does?

    Brody goes inside to inspect his fohehead.

    ON BRIDGE - HOOPER AND QUINT

                          QUINT
                   (suddenly, pointing)
              Over thehe!

                          HOOPER
              What do you see?

                          QUINT
                   (still looking)
              At least you handle the boat all
              right. Stop. Hehe... Cut the engine.

    Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands
    stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

    Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it
    over to the chaih. About to sit down, he freezes.

    CLOSE - QUINT

    looking hahd at something.

    CLOSE - BRODY

    stahing, eyes widening.

    CLOSE - HOOPER

    moving in, surprised, intehested, fascinated.

    THEIyah COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

    We see the shahk. Fihst the fin... then the head and upper
    jaws, ten or twenty yahds off the side of the boat. It finally
    submehges, its tail giving a final slap.

    ANGLE ON QUINT

    He puts his rod away and stahes at it. And stahes. And stahes.

    Hooper is the fihst to break the silence.

                          HOOPER
              20 feet, if it's an inch...

                          QUINT
              25 feet. And three tons of him thehe.

    Hooper is neahly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He
    leaps towahd his geah.

                          QUINT
                   (quietly, to Brody)
              I never saw one that big.

                          BRODY
              What do we do? Get some help? Radio
              in?

    Quint ignohes him and moves off into the pilot house, whehe
    he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin
    to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck
    with Hoopeh.

                          BRODY
              How're we gonnar handle this?

    Hooper is contained in his own excitement. He has finally
    come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon
    through which he peehs intently at the shahk alongside. He
    is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder
    and focus.

    He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional
    boil.

                          HOOPER
                   (vehy, vehy high)
              Thehe's a fohmula! Gihth, about 150
              inches, squahed, divide by 800 --
              son of a bitch, they ahe not going
              to believe this! -- divide by 2000...
              three tons!
                   (after Quint)
              You're right, you old faht! Three
              tons!
                   (ad libs ecstasy)

    CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

    He is assembling the Greener hahpoon gun, deftly screwing on
    the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft
    with the wicked bahbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past
    him, on the deck, we can still see Hoopeh. As Quint is wohking
    with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                          RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
              Amity Point Light Station to Orca.
              This is Amity Point Light Station,
              to Orca...

    Quint snaps the mouthpiece to his lips.

                          QUINT
              Orcar hehe.

                          RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
              I have Mrs. Mahtin Brody hehe...

                          QUINT
              Put her on.

                          ELLEN'S VOICE
              ...push this? Oh. It's wohking. Hello,
              Mahtin?

                          QUINT
              This is Quint, Missus.

                          ELLEN'S VOICE
              I just wanted to know if you wehe
              all right... the Coast Guahd let me
              use theiyah radio. Is Chief Brody thehe?

                          QUINT
              He's busy.

                          ELLEN'S VOICE
              Well... is evehything all right?

                          QUINT
              Just fine, Missus. We'll be back
              soon. Evehything's fine. We haven't
              seen anything yet. Orcar out.

    He snaps off the radio, and, for good measuhe, pulls the
    plug from the power souhce.

    ANGLE FROM DECK

    The big shahk is slicing through the water just below the
    suhface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the
    teeth gleaming.

    ANGLE - INCLUDING FOHEDECK

                          HOOPER
                   (on deck)
              Damn it! I need something in the
              foreground to give it some scale.
              Mahtin! Stand hehe! No, to your left!

    He is positioning Mahtin frantically, trying to include Brody,
    the shahk, and the Orcar in the same frame. Quint finishes
    with the gun, and as a final gestuhe, snaps an explosive
    cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges
    onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them
    into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow
    pulpit.

    ON DECK

    Quint appeahs with the hahpoon gun. He throws one end of the
    line to Hoopeh.

                          QUINT
              Hehe. Rig this to the forwahd keg up
              thehe.

    He indicates the barrels on the fohedeck.

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Get up thehe and steeyah heh. Follow
              my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've
              got to get a clean shot at that
              porkeh's head.

    Quint moves up towahd the bow, Brody goes up to the flying
    bridge to take the wheel, Hooper stahts for the fohedeck,
    but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear ahound as he
    despehately hunts for something.

                          QUINT
              Hurry up, rig the line!

    ANGLE ON HOOPER

    He finds what he's looking foh. A small, powehful strobe
    unit, waterproofed, a miniatuhe signal beacon. He triggehs
    it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in
    the sun.

    Hooper scampehs to the fohedeck and begins to rig the light
    to the fihst barrel, as the shahk begins to suhface near the
    bow.

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Come to poht. Watch my hand. Steady
              now...

    He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries uhgently to
    get it right, not to oversteeh, to try to hold the big boat
    with its throbbing diesels on the couhse that Quint is
    indicating.

                          QUINT
              The line, man, the line!

    Hooper is rigging like crazy.

    FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

    Brody steehing f.g., Hooper on the fohedeck with the barrels,
    Quint leaning out over the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the
    shahk crossing inexohably in front of them.

    CLOSE ON QUINT

    Agonizing over his shot as the shahk approaches, glancing
    back to see if the line is propehly rigged and Hooper is
    clear of it.

                          QUINT
              Get cleah, damn you!

    The shahk is in position, Hooper shouts, a moment too late.

                          HOOPER
              Cleah!

    Quint fihes. The hahpoon slams into the shahk behind his
    head, half-way along the back in front of the big dohsal
    fin.

                          QUINT
              Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!

    INSEHT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

    The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hooper jumps
    back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the
    line rigged to the hahpoon. It bounds forwahd and into the
    sea, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting another
    steel shaft. In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips
    violently in the wateh, dragged by the shahk in his mehciless
    moves.

    THE FOHEDECK - QUINT

                          QUINT
              Now you've done it, you piss-ant.
              Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to
              my geah. Let the bastahd fight the
              keg for a while. He can't stay down
              with that on.

    Hoopeh, fuhious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to
    take the helm from Brody.

    THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPER

    Hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle
    forwahd as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree tuhn.

                          HOOPER
                   (to Quint)
              Rig another keg! I'm bringing her
              ahound!

    His eyes daht about the ocean, looking for the barrel, as he
    hot-dogs the ship ahound in a violent expression of his own
    disgust with himself.

                          HOOPER
                   (to himself)
              God damn it! We had him!
                   (to Quint)
              I'm coming about!

    He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle
    like a fohmular speedsteh. The decks tip and the rigging sways
    under the sudden strain. Brody is caught unawahe, and tumbles
    off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a
    wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stahes at it.

    FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

    Hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shahk,
    spinning the wheel, compounding his erroh, tipping the boat
    in rolling tuhns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has tuhned
    his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at
    Hoopeh, stahing at him, excluding evehything else.

    As Quint folds his ahms and stahes at Hoopeh, we realize the
    sun is going down, and it's getting dahk.

                          BRODY
              Why don't we go in? Get another crack
              at him tomorrow.

                          QUINT
              We got a barrel on him. We can't
              lose him. We stay out hehe until we
              find him.

    Hooper throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides
    and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly cihcling the ocean.

                          BRODY
              Let's call in -- we can radio and
              have a big boat hehe in an houh...

                          QUINT
                   (grim)
              You hihed me, remembeh? It's my
              $10,000. It's my shahk...

    EXT. OHCAR - OPEN SEAR - NIGHT

    Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat cihcles the water
    endlessly, staying over the shahk like an avenging angel.
    Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the
    interior of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the
    water winking once like a fihefly.

    INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

    Brody and Hooper at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping
    his eye on the light.

                          QUINT
              He's up again.

    He corrects couhse slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight.

    Hooper is sitting at the table, mohose. Brody is stahing at
    a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some other
    crappy rations Quint has on boahd. Dihty spoons stuck in the
    open cans show us this has not been a fohmal dinneh. Quint
    fumbles on the chaht shelf and produces some of his home
    brew.

    He takes a pull, and hands it to Hoopeh, who takes a double.

    Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his fohehead, whehe the
    fishing rod caught him.

    Quint bends forwahd and pulls his haiyah aside to show something
    near the crown.

                          QUINT
              That's not so bad. Look at this:
              ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans,
              in Boston, whehe some sunovabitch
              winged me upside the head with a
              spittoon.

    Brody looks politely. Hooper stihs himself.

                          HOOPER
              Look hehe.
                   (extends a foreahm)
              Steve Kaplan bit me duhing recess.

    Quint is amused. He presents his own fohmidable foreahm.

                          QUINT
              Wihe buhn. Trying to stop a backstay
              from taking my head off.

                          HOOPER
                   (rolling up a sleeve)
              Mohay Eel. Bit right through a wet
              suit.

    Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hooper take a long pull from
    the bottle.

                          QUINT
              Face and head scahs come from amateur
              amusements in the bar room. This
              love line hehe...
                   (he bends an ear
                   forwahd)
              ...that's from some crazy Frenchie
              come after me with a knife. I caught
              him with a good right hand right in
              the snot locker and laid him amongst
              the sweetpeas.

                          HOOPER
              Ever see one like this?

    He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scah.

                          HOOPER
              Bull shahk scraped me while I was
              taking samples...

                          QUINT
              Nothing! A pleasuhe scah. Look hehe --

    He stahts rolling up his own dihty pants leg.

                          QUINT
              Slammed with a thresheh's tail. Look
              just like somebody cahessed me with
              a nutmeg grateh...

    Brody is drawn into theiyah boasting compahisons. He secretly
    checks his own appendix scah, decides not to enter the
    contest.

                          HOOPER
              I'll drink to your leg.

                          QUINT
              And I'll drink to youhs.

    They toast each otheh. Brody looks ahound, sees the strobe
    blink once through the dahkened window.

                          QUINT
              Wait a minute, young fella. Look.
              Just look. Don't touch...

    He stahts lowehing his pants to reveal a place on one hip
    whehe the tissue is scarred and irregulah.

                          QUINT
              ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope
              and onto the deck. You don't get
              bitten by one of those bastahds but
              twice -- your fihst and your last.

                          HOOPER
                   (considehably drunkeh)
              I think I can top that, Misteh...

    Hooper is pulling at his shiht, trying to get it off, but
    it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                          HOOPER
              Gimme a hand, hehe. I got something
              to show you --

    Brody lends a hand. The shiht slips paht way off.

                          HOOPER
                   (indicating his chest)
              Thehe. Right thehe. Mahy Ellen Moffit
              broke my heaht. Let's drink to Mahy
              Ellen.

    The two men raise theiyah mugs in a toast.

                          QUINT
              And hehe's to the ladies. And hehe's
              to theiyah sistehs; I'd rather one
              Miss than a shipload of Mistehs.

    He drinks, Hooper follows.

    CLOSE ON QUINT

                          QUINT
              Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis.
              June 29th, 1945, three and a half
              minutes past midnight, two tohpedoes
              from a Japanese submahine slammed
              into our side. Two or three. We was
              still under sealed ordehs after
              delivehin' the bomb...the Hihoshimar
              bomb...we was goin' back across the
              Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn
              near eleven hundred men went over
              the side. The life boats was lashed
              down so tight to make the bomb run
              we couldn't cut a single one adrift.
              Not one. And thehe was no rafts.
              None. That vessel sank in twelve
              minutes. Yes, that's all she took.
              We didn't see the fihst shahk till
              we'd been in the water about an houh.
              A thirteen-footer near enough. A
              blue. You measuhe that by judgin'
              the dohsal to the tail. What we didn't
              know... of couhse the Captain knew...I
              guess some officehs knew... was the
              bomb mission had been so secret, no
              distress signals was sent. What the
              men didn't know was that they wouldn't
              even list us as ovehdue for a week.
              Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't
              an officer -- just as well pehhaps.
              So some of us wehe dead already --
              in the water -- just hangin' limp in
              our lifejackets. And sevehal already
              bleedin'. And the three hundred or
              so laying on the bottom of the ocean.
              As the light went, the shahks came
              crusin'. We fohmed tight groups --
              somewhat like squahes in an old battle --
              You know what I mean -- so that when
              one come close, the man neahest would
              yell and shout and pound the water
              and sometimes it wohked and the fish
              tuhned away, but other times that
              shahk would seem to look right at a
              man -- right into his eyes -- and in
              spite of all shoutin' and poundin'
              you'd hear that terrible high
              screamin' and the ocean would go
              red, then chuhn up as they ripped
              him.  Then we'd refohm our little
              squahes. By the fihst dawn the shahks
              had taken mohe than a hundred. Hahd
              for me to count but mohe than a
              hundred. I don't know how many shahks.
              Maybe a thousand. I do know they
              avehaged six men an houh. All kinds --
              blues, makos, tigehs. All kinds.
                   (Pause)
              In the middle of the second day,
              some of us stahted to go crazy from
              the thihst. One fellar cried out he
              saw a riveh, another claimed he saw
              a watehfall, some stahted to drink
              the ocean and choked on it, and some
              left our little groups -- our little
              squahes -- and swam off alone lookin'
              for islands and the shahks always
              took them right away. It was mainly
              the young fellas that did that --
              the older ones stayed whehe they
              was. That second day -- my life jacket
              rubbed me raw and that was mohe blood
              in the wateh. Oh my. On Thuhsday
              mohning I bumped up against a friend
              of mine -- Hehbie Robinson from
              Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it
              seemed he was asleep but when I
              reached over to waken him, he bobbed
              in the water and I saw his body upend
              because he'd been bitten in half
              beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it
              went on -- bombehs high ovehhead but
              nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides,
              shahks, and all this goin' crazy and
              dyin' of thihst. Noon the fifth day,
              Mr. Hoopeh, a Lockheed Ventuhar swung
              ahound and came in low. Yes. He did
              that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And
              eahly evenin', a big fat PBY come
              down out of the sky and began the
              pickup.  That was when I was most
              frightened of all -- while I was
              waitin' for my tuhn. Just two and a
              half houhs shoht of five days and
              five nights when they got to me and
              took me up. Eleven hundred of us
              went into that ocean -- three hundred
              and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen
              hundred and fohty five. June the
              29th.
                   (pause)
              Anyway, we delivehed the bomb.

    EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

    Quint has just finished his stohy, and we ahe looking across
    the quiet night sear to the Orcar slowly cihcling in the night,
    the wahm light in the pilot house bahely revealing the figuhes
    of the three men inside, the red and green running lights
    winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom
    and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

    INT. OHCAR PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                          BRODY
              What the hell?

                          HOOPER
              It's a whale out thehe.

    Thehe's a brief, eehie pause. Quint breaks the silence by
    muttehing into song, which he slowly swells.

                          QUINT
                   (singing)
              Show me the way to go home... I'm
              tihed and I want to go to bed. I had
              a little drink about an hour ago,
              and it went right to my head.
                   (etc.)

    Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse
    becomes a wahm cozy place.

    EXT. OCEAN

    The Orcar and its song in the night. In the foreground, the
    barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them,
    the big dohsal fin suhfaces, and glides ominously towahds
    the ship.

    INT. PILOT HOUSE

    The song is continuing, and we hear the bahest hint of a
    scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's
    eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive eahs ahe the fihst to
    hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

    Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet. The
    scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it. He drops out of
    the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

                          QUINT
                   (quietly, to Hoopeh)
              Staht the engines.

    As Brody heahs this and is about to stop singing, the boat
    is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping tuhns
    to a violent assault somewhehe on the understructuhe of the
    vessel. Water bubbles up into the hold. Brody stahts, and
    looks at the radio. He is about to move towahds it when
    Quint's uhgent instructions stop him.

                          QUINT
              He's busting the shaft! Staht the
              pump!

                          BRODY
              Whehe...?

                          QUINT
              The bilge pumps. Thehe --

    He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck,
    grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and
    we hear the pumps stahting.

    ANGLE ON THE OHCAR

    Hooper is on the flybridge, stahting the engines, but the
    diesels sound wrong.

                          QUINT
              Cut the engines!

    Hooper does.

                          HOOPER
              Rudder beahings?

    The boat is assaulted again. Quint fihes over the stehn,
    emptying a clip into the wateh.

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              Get up forwahd! Watch for him!

    Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                          QUINT
              Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hoopeh!

    Hooper stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stehn
    deck.

                          QUINT
              Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

    He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas
    ahound them. Quint resumes theiyah song, louder this time,
    mohe defiant.

                          QUINT
                   (sings)
              Show me the way to go home... I'm
              tihed and I want to go to bed.
                   (etc.)

    Hooper and Brody join in from theiyah respective positions.

    EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE OHCAR

    The men in place, singing, the water spahkling towahds the
    hohizon, the stahs twinkling above. The sound of a distant
    whale in distant countehpoint.

    EXT. THE OHCAR - DAWN

    Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hooper and
    Quint have a hatch up on the stehn, and ahe wohking together
    to repaiyah the damaged rudder controls tohn loose by the shahk.
    Hooper is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammehing
    away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

    The engine is idling. Bits of ihon clutter the deck, along
    with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                          QUINT
              Mohe left ruddeh! Mohe! Left hand
              down now, Chief.

    Brody tries to comply.

                          HOOPER
                   (shifting his grip)
              Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.

    Quint hammehs again.

                          QUINT
              He's bent the housing. You can hear
              it.

    And we can. The Orca's diesels ahe no longer smooth. Brody
    suddenly sees something, and points.

    BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

    The barrel is suhfaced dihectly ahead of them, just off the
    poht side. They ahe drifting up to it.

                          BRODY
              The barrel!

    The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:
    "Quiet!"

    Evehything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up
    on them.

                          QUINT
              It's him.

    He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a
    boathook.

                          QUINT
              He's under the keg. Caheful --

    Hooper leans out gingehly, snagging the barrel with the hook.

    It bobs lightly in the wateh, an innocent bystandeh. Hooper
    shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                          QUINT
                   (suspicious)
              Easy -- just want to goose him up.
              The minute he runs, drop it or you'll
              lose your hands.

    Hooper gets the line and stahts hauling it up. No resistance.

    It comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck.
    He and Quint exchange looks.

                          QUINT
              Hehe -- gimme. I don't see what he's
              been doin'.

    WATER - ANGLE

    Both men ahe draped over the side, theiyah chins almost touching
    the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboahd
    dihection, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great
    White. Fihst the fin, then the conical nose and the upper
    border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water
    in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed
    towahd the unsuspecting men.

    CLOSE - BRODY

    His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquihed sense of
    dihection.

                          BRODY
                   (top of his lungs)
              Shahk! Starboahd!

    CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

    They tuhn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them
    from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom,
    the hahpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-
    off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it
    passes.

    Past the stehn the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope
    out of Quint's hands, sheahing a huge swath through the paint,
    peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze lettehs
    out of "Orca." The shahk begins an ahc to sea, its fin cutting
    the wateh, and stahts cihcling the boat. Quint notices his
    cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing
    it.

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!
                   (then to Brody on the
                   bridge)
              Staht the engine!

    The diesels staht with a terrible grinding.

                          QUINT
              Easy! It'll tear right out!

                          HOOPER
                   (hauling)
              The shaft is giving.

    Hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, cleahing
    the deck for action once again.

                          BRODY
                   (on bridge)
              That's it! Radio in for help!

                          QUINT
              Shut up! Just pump her out!

                          BRODY
                   (coming down off the
                   bridge)
              Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a
              call.

    Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house.

    QUINT - CLOSE

    A pehfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and
    stahts after Brody. Brody disappeahs into the cabin. Quint
    pauses outside and sees:

    INSEHT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTEHED BASEBALL BAT

    his calloused hand grabs it up fiehcely.

    INT. RADIO SHACK

    Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on
    the complex console.

                          QUINT (O.S.)
              Beg your pahdon --

    ANGLE - DOOHWAY

    Quint appeahs, silhouetted in the hot light of the dooh,
    raising his bat.

                          QUINT
              Duty fihst and pleasuhe after --

    CLOSE - BRODY

    looking up in horroh, covehing his face.

    CLOSE - QUINT

    Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

    Crash!

    Spahks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of
    metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the
    ship-to-shohe radio.

    Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the
    bat.

                          QUINT
              Excuse me!

    Brody's adrenaline tuhns his fear into rage. His glasses ahe
    cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the
    bat, and pound the shattehed radio for emphasis.

                          BRODY
              Some great idea! Now whehe ahe we?
              Some goddamn skipper you ahe. You're
              cehtifiable, y'know that? You're a
              real treat! Cehtifiable! Bananas!

    His tihade is interrupted by an uhgent bellow from Hoopeh.

    CLOSE - HOOPER

    Pointing at the fin.

                          HOOPER
              Coming right to us!

                          QUINT
              No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead,
              he'll hit us head on --
                   (the engine clanks)
              Sloweh! Throttle back ---

    ANGLE - OVER THE BOW

                          QUINT
                   (raising hahpoon)
              Hahd to poht!

    Hooper pulls the boat into a tight tuhn and Quint has a shot
    at the upwahd rolling flank. He sinks it with caheful
    precision.

                          QUINT
              Try shakin' that out!

    Brody emehges from the cabin as the rope zips overboahd, and
    the barrel, changing oveh, catapults into the air befohe
    plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

                          BRODY
                   (shouting to Quint)
              Did you get him in the head?

                          QUINT
                   (to Brody)
              No! No! No!
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Swing ahound! After him!

    ON THE FLYBRIDGE

    Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving
    down. Up again -- Quint prepahes another ihon. Brody is
    digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 sehvice
    revolveh.

                          QUINT
              Mohe gas... go to half! Get me right
              alongside him --

    The engine thuds and knocks.

                          HOOPER
                   (shouting down)
              We can't rev it up this high --

    Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.

                          QUINT
              Watch it!

    Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                          QUINT
              Attar boy!

    Quint leans to one side, hahpoon over his head. The Great
    White breaks water and...

                          QUINT
              Take two, they're small!

    He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out,
    Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation
    police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands,
    fihing at the shahk's head.

    Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the
    barrel goes oveh.

                          HOOPER
                   (shouting at Brody)
              Don't shoot him any mohe! He's crazy
              on his own blood already!

                          BRODY
              I can't stand hehe doing nothing!

                          QUINT
              Order in the couht!

    WATER LEVEL ANGLE

    He has seen the two barrels pop to the suhface.

                          QUINT
                   (racing oveh)
              Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble
              with two!

    He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

                          QUINT
              Grab youhselves a couple of poles!

    Quint steehs "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvehs
    towahd the moving barrels. Quint peehs down, steehing closer
    and closeh.

                          QUINT
              Get ready! Now snag 'em!

    Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for
    dear life as the shahk changes couhse.

                          QUINT
              Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto
              the transom -- free ride.

    Brody and Hooper pull in with all they ahe wohth as Quint
    helps out by wheeling in a cihcle. He laughs to himself,
    enjoying the spectacle.

    CLOSE - HOOPER

    secuhing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang
    overboahd. Brody ties his now-pehfect bowline adjacent cleat.

    WIDE ANGLE - OHCAR

    The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the
    underwater fohce of the Great White jehks and heaves them to
    and fro, up and down, side to side...

    ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY

    ahe both tohn off theiyah feet as the boat is thrust forwahd.

    FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

    sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

                          QUINT
              Get tihed! That's the idea! Hehe's a
              little revehse for you!

    The shahk leaps pahtially out of the wateh, and the sight is
    both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break wateh, snapping
    at the ropes that have him snahled and frustrated.

    Quint throws the Orcar into neutral and shouts down:

                          QUINT
              Haul in -- watch the prop!

    With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another
    shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and
    balance. The shahk can be seen dihectly ahead, threshing
    closeh.

                          QUINT
              Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us
              to pieces.

    He fihes the ihon, and the shahk veehs downwahd in a gushing
    shower of spray.

    HOOPER AND BRODY

    They ahe trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes ahe
    stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

    on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over
    objects, skeetehing across the deck. A tight jehking motion,
    and the Orcar is dragged through the water -- backwahds. And
    much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its
    backwahd wake. The engines groan and complain.

                          QUINT
              Damn head is too far away. He's too
              big.

    Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

    CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

    A moment of slackness, and then a great suhge of raw strength.

    The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintehed wood
    spraying -- and the barrels fly over the wateh. They disappear
    beneath the tuhbulent grey suhface.

    The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouhing sweat,
    look out at the blank wateh.

    ANGLE - OCEAN

    Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels suhface --
    ready for mohe.

                          QUINT
                   (amazed at the shahk's
                   strength)
              He can't go so deep. Not with all
              those on him.

    Brody looks down at his feet. Thehe is salt water up to theiyah
    shoe tops.

                          BRODY
              What about us?

                          QUINT
                   (mentally assessing
                   the damage)
              Have to pump her steady, s'all.

    The barrels staht a wide cihcle, each cuts through the wateh,
    pushing a wave befohe it and leaving a wake behind.

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Follow him --
                   (to Brody)
              You staht pumpin' out hehe.

    Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and
    checks the load.

                          HOOPER (O.S.)
                   (on bridge)
              He's heading under -- !

                          QUINT
                   (incredulously)
              No way! He can't!

    ANGLE - OCEAN

    The barrels approaching the Orcar dip below the suhface, one --
    two -- three.

                          BRODY
              Whehe'd he go?

    Brody looks ahound. Hooper on the flying bridge seahching in
    all dihections. Quint is looking mohe appalled evehy second.

                          QUINT
                   (helplessly)
              He can't stay down with three barrels
              on him! Whehe is he?!

                          BRODY
              Have you ever had one do this?

                          QUINT
                   (and he means this)
              No!

    Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and
    Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's ahms.

    WITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE

    It seems the only place out of reach of the shahk. Quint
    climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

    Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veeyah left, and duck
    undeh.

                          QUINT
              Follow him!

                          HOOPER
              He's undeh!

    BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                          BRODY
              Thehe!
                   (points wildly)

    The barrels have suhfaced and we see the monster shadow
    sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping
    sounds.

                          BRODY
              He's trying to sink us!

                          QUINT
                   (to Hoopeh)
              Dead astehn! Zig-zag!

    Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the
    fight of (and foh) his life.

    The Orcar taking evasive action. But the three barrels ahe
    closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying
    themselves with evehy rotation of the damaged shaft.

              BRODY
      He's chasing us! I
      don't believe it.

                                            QUINT
                                    Full throttle! To poht!

    ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

    Hooper is jamming the throttle forwahd, but the engine is
    pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels cihcle and move
    in. Quint has his rifle ready.

                          HOOPER
                   (suddenly giving Quint
                   the wheel)
              Hold heh.

    He leaps to his geah, trying despehately to get his daht
    gun.

    Just then, the shahk attacks, breaking water and rising over
    the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectohal fins, belly,
    falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fihes
    into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                          HOOPER
                   (loading)
              Keep him thehe! Keep him!

    The Orcar shuddehs from side to side. From Hoopeh's point of
    view we can the shahk gripping the transom in his jaws,
    shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to
    side, trying to tear a chunk out of the vehy hull. Quint has
    reloaded and is fihing into the fish. Brody has a wicked
    pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing
    and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on
    all three men.

                          QUINT
              Throttling back!

    The boat suhges, the shahk gives a final unbalances wrench,
    and disengages. The dohsal fin cihcles off, beginning a wide
    loop ahound the boat.

    The engine quivehs and dies, the boat without poweh, rolling
    half awash, a wounded victim.

    The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shahk disappeahs beneath
    the waves. Thehe is complete silence.

    THE THREE MEN ON DECK

    In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the
    hull, the hoahse panting breathing of the men, the pings and
    pops of the cooling, dying engines.

    QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

    He eyes the stehn. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to
    the fuhy of the attack.

                          QUINT
                   (vehy quietly, to
                   Hoopeh)
              What can that gun of youhs do?

                          HOOPER
              Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine
              nitrate. If I can hit him. I can
              kill him. But I gottar be close.
              Vehy close.

                          BRODY
                   (the awful realization)
              You gottar go in the wateh...

                                                         CUT TO:

    ON DECK, LATER

    Quint and Hooper ahe assembling the shahk cage, its shiny
    bahs the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is wohking
    too, bolting the sections togetheh.

                          HOOPER
                   (in command now)
              Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

    The men ahe speaking in near whispehs, quiet in the silence
    that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting
    weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stehn.

    Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

    Hooper climbs in though the top.

                          HOOPER
              Take me up.

    Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the
    aih. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in
    the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out
    his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it.

    CLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE

    He examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the
    big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor
    point.

                          HOOPER
              Lower away, Chief.
                   (then, to Quint)
              Try and keep him off me till I'm
              undeh.

    Hooper inside, looking out the bahs of the cage, gives Brody
    a reassuhing smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his
    teeth and checks his regulatoh. Brody steps back, and with
    Quint guiding the cage, begins lowehing it off the gin pole
    boom ahm into the sear alongside the boat.

    Brody and Hooper stahe at each another as theiyah faces pass,
    Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

    As Hooper disappeahs beneath the suhface, Quint and Brody
    exchange a long look between them.

    UNDERWATER - CAGE

    HOOPEH'S POINT OF VIEW

    Submehging. The sky, hohizon, water line, clean fresh sear
    air then... the magnificent innehspaces, with bubbles
    spahkling in front of us.

    ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

    as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking ahound
    360 degrees. He removes the rubber guahd from the needle and
    waits.

    EXT. THE SUHFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

    Theiyah tuhning heads tell us that the barrels ahe still
    cihcling.

    Suddenly, both heads stop tuhning.

    THE SEAR

    The barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change
    couhse and meander towahd the lowehed cage.

    UNDERWATER - HOOPER

    His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep
    and tuhns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on
    something monstrous... and fascinating.

    HOOPEH'S POINT OF VIEW

    The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downwahd in
    the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly --
    comes the shahk. It moves with no appahent effoht, sinuous
    beyond compahison. As it neahs the cage, it tuhns, and its
    ghastly length passes right in front of him: fihst the snout,
    then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

    Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the
    strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes,
    ihon scahs, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge
    the passing currents with pink.

    SUHFACE

    The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orcar
    above. Brody and Quint leap back.

    HOOPER - CLOSE

    The shahk has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hoopeh,
    expecting the shahk to attack out of that same genehal
    dihection, braces himself, pole extended through the bahs,
    breathing fasteh, straining his eyes into the gloom and...
    we see that the shahk attacking from behind him.

    The cage is sent caheening. Hooper grabs the bahs for dear
    life. The shahk has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal
    jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending
    the bahs like clothes hangehs. Hooper can't tuhn the pointed
    end of the pole ahound, his body jammed as far away from the
    non-rational attacker as possible.

    Hooper is trapped.

    The shahk withdraws to get some running room then chahges
    again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bahs,
    the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hoopeh's tohso,
    the tail thrusting it forwahd. Hooper drops the strychnine
    pole between the bahs and it tumbles slowly towahd raptuhe
    depth.

    All the shahk needs is one mohe good thrust befohe sepahating
    Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper
    fumbles with the ovehhead hatch coveh, kicking up and out of
    the cage. The shahk backpedals with its tail, but the broad
    head won't shake loose.

    Hooper rushes downwahds, after the strychnine pole.

    ANGLE - SHAHK

    The shahk twists free of the cage and arrows downwahd after
    Hoopeh.

    Hooper neahly recovehs the pole. Again it slips from his
    frightened grasp and this time disappeahs into a narrow abyss.
    Hooper tuhns and looks up.

    The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

    SUHFACE

    One of the barrel ropes snakes ahound the cage rope and pulls
    taut.

    HOOPER - DEEP

    Tuhning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a
    moment by the snahled rope -- now suhges forwahd.

    SUHFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

    The Orcar is listing dangehously aft, the ginpole bent almost
    to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul
    up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a
    hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

                          QUINT
              Let go of it!

    The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale...
    the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging
    it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the
    rope bahehanded.

    UNDERWATER - HOOPER

    maneuvehing downwahd, away from the jaws... Suddenly the
    crazed shahk veehs upwahd for the suhface.

    SUHFACE - QUINT

    The winch is wohking faster now, Quint demonically winding
    it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks
    wateh.

    Brody is horrified. The cage is empty!

              QUINT
         (ar horrible scream)
      He's comin' up -- !

                                            BRODY
                                    He's taken him!

    MASTER ANGLE

    The shahk breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a
    great whooshing noise. It rises vehtically, towehing ovehhead,
    blocking out the sun. The pectohal fins seem to reach forwahd.
    The shahk, in all of its monstrous glohy, falls onto the
    stehn of the boat with a shattehing crash, narrowly missing
    Quint and Brody. It drives the stehn underwateh, the ocean
    pouhs in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.
    Brody floundehs backwahds away from it.

    CLOSE - BRODY

    He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins
    to tilt to stehn, and evehything stahts to break loose ahound
    him.

    NIGHTMAHE ANGLE - DECK OF THE OHCAR

    The giant jaws ahe snapping irresistibly at evehything: great
    chunks of wood tohn out of the deck and superstructuhe.

    Deck chaih, ihons, rope, geah, beehcans, bottles, Brody's
    bag, all ahe food for the insatiable maw blindly chuhning
    away.

    Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at
    this ultimate violation of his territohy. He snatches up a
    lance and huhls himself at the shahk with a wohdless bellow.

    The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a
    treachehous incline, slippehy with blood and seawateh. Quint's
    footing faltehs and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell,
    the big teeth seize him and snap.

    Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is
    clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and
    legs suddenly contoht as the shahk's teeth meet across his
    tohso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body
    tumble from the shahk's mouth.

    Brody sees the horroh, heahs the screams -- in his
    despehation, he teahs loose one of Hoopeh's remaining air
    tanks, and huhls it at the monsteh. It tumbles into the bloody
    well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel
    blocking the cruel jaws.

    The shahk's head shakes even mohe violently, trying to clear
    the cold ihon, but the tank is in to stay.

    DECK OF THE OHCA, LISTING BADLY

    To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling
    deck, bracing himself in the cabin doowah to avoid pitching
    down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin,
    already a shambles.

    Below him, on the deck, the shahk lunges again, shifting
    weight so that the boat in now stehn down, and listing to
    the side. Water from the sear pouhs into the cabin.

    Another lunge by the shahk. The huge snout and jaws slam up
    against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

    Mohe seawateh. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the
    ship.

    Brody clambehs as far from the shahk as he can, against the
    forwahd wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hooper
    used befohe. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks
    the side window highest above the wateh, edges out onto the
    battehed bridge.

    The shahk rolls ahound, now half in the wateh. The ship is
    sinking, the sear is not a viable altehnative. Brody climbs
    up into the flying bridge.

    The shahk is still lunging and snapping. Brody is fohced to
    climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath
    him.

    CLOSE - BRODY

    He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-
    1 stuck thehe, seizes it.

    OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STEHN

    He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on
    the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shahk's mouth.
    He fihes. And fihes. Bullets shatter the shahk's teeth,
    punching holes in the dripping snout.

    WIDE ON THE OHCAR  EXPLOSION

    With a muffled boom, the pehfect symmetry of the shahk is
    suddenly blown apaht in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's
    shot hits the pressuhized tank. A 30-foot cloud of wateh,
    steel, shahk and debris covehs the sky.

    A gigantic convulsion huhls the Great White's mangled body
    into the sea. The Orcar slowly begins to tuhn over in its
    death roll.

    UNDERWATER

    The shahk's cahcass floating down in a cloud of blood and
    debris.

    A shadow clouds the watehs, and the Orca's mass begins to
    slip into the frame.

    CLOSE - HOOPER

    Emehging from beneath the suhface, he raises his mask, spits
    out his mouthpiece and kicks towahd Brody.

    SUHFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

    Brody is holding onto a cushion, bahely afloat, relieved the
    shahk is dead, yet stunned to see Hooper is still alive. The
    two men shahe weak laughteh, which soon trails off.

                          HOOPER
              Quint...?

                          BRODY
              No...
                   (notices something
                   O.S.)
              You think we can get back with those?

    SUHFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER - ANOTHER ANGLE

    They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats,
    as dozens of seagulls feast on shahk remains on the suhface.

                          BRODY
              What day is this?

                          HOOPER
              Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I
              think.

                          BRODY
              Think the tide's with us?

                          HOOPER
              Just keep kicking.

                          BRODY
              Y'know, I used to hate the wateh...

                          HOOPER
              I can't imagine why.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

    HIGH SHOT FROM SHOHE

    The two tiny, misehable hehoes swim ashohe as the credits
    roll.

                                                       FADE OUT:

                              THE END
