Jaws.java README

Objective: Given a .txt file of the script of the movie Jaws, write a program that reads the script from the file, convert the text to its equivalent in a Southie accent
and write the converted text to an output file. 

Southie Accent Rules:
 - If there is an 'r' following a vowel, replace 'r' with 'h'
 - If a word ends in 'a, append an 'r'
 - Replace the word 'very' with the word 'wicked'

Exceptions:
 - If 'r' is at the end of a word and is preceded by 'ee' or 'i' replace 'r' with 'yah' instead of 'h'
 - If 'r' is at the end of a word and is preceded by 'oo' replace 'r' with 'wah'
